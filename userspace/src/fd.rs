//! handlers: a handler reads `arg0` as an `fd` (a small u32), looks
//! it up in the calling task's table, and routes the operation to
//! the backing `FileOps` impl. fd 0..=2 are reserved for stdin /
//! stdout / stderr; subsequent slots are first-free.
//!
//! The table is per-task and stored in a global `BTreeMap<TaskId,
//! FdTable>`. Tests + the scheduler call `attach_to(task_id, ops)`
//! to install a backing FileOps; the `Open` handler (when wired)
//! calls `attach_to(current_task, ops)` after VFS resolves a path.
//! `detach(task_id)` removes the whole table on task exit.

// the underlying open-file object identity (`Arc::as_ptr` cast to
// usize), so two fds that point at the same inode share locks. Each
// file's bucket holds a `Weak` to that object, which keeps the address
// from being handed to another file while any record is keyed by it —
// see `Bucket`.
// Conflict rule: a write lock conflicts with any other lock on an
// overlapping range; a read lock conflicts only with a write lock.
// `owner` is the holding task id — same owner replaces / extends.
//
// F_SETLKW (blocking) is *not* wired to a waker; today it returns
// EAGAIN on conflict just like F_SETLK. A follow-up wave will add
// the per-inode wait queue.
