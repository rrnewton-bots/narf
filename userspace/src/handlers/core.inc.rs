// Tasks parked in `epoll_wait`/`poll` register their waker here while
// blocked. When inbound TCP data lands, the net stack calls
// `crate::readiness::notify` → `wake_io_waiters` (installed at boot),
// which clears each waiter's sleep deadline and fires its waker so it
// re-polls readiness immediately. Without this, a parked epoll task
// only re-checks at its next wheel deadline — redis's ~100 ms
// serverCron tick — turning a sub-ms round-trip into ~80 ms.

/// Number of wake-path shards (power of two). `IO_WAKERS` is touched on the
/// RX forwarder per inbound segment (targeted wake of the owning task) AND
/// by every worker that parks/unparks in epoll — a single global lock there
/// serialized the forwarder against all workers. `TCB_OWNER` likewise. Both
/// are keyed by id (task id / tcb id), so sharding decouples the forwarder's
/// per-segment touch (the owner's shard) from unrelated workers' park shards.

// inode number, so instead of an inode/fid encoding we store the file's
// absolute path directly in `f_handle[]` — a self-contained, stateless
// handle that round-trips through both syscalls. `handle_type` carries a
// NARF marker so a foreign handle is rejected with ESTALE.

// ── Dup family + fcntl ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Stage-4 round 2: the dup'd fd is a *clone* of the source FdEntry —
// `ops` Arc shared, `offset` reset to 0 on the duplicate. Real POSIX
// `dup` shares the open-file description (so reads on either fd
// advance the same offset); NARF's fd table is currently a flat
// `FdEntry`-per-slot rather than the POSIX two-tier (fd → OFD →
// inode) layout. The simplification is sound for Stage-4 callers
// (relibc's `dup` is used to redirect stdio post-fork, not to share
// a cursor) and is documented here so the Stage-5 OFD work can lift
// the offset into a separate Arc without touching the syscall ABI.

// ── ioctl(2) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Generic ioctl dispatcher. `cmd` is the Linux-shaped `_IOC` encoded
// request word (dir|size|type|nr); `arg` is the raw user-pointer
// argument the caller passed in RDX (on x86_64). Every per-fd
// `FileOps` impl decides which `cmd` values it recognises, validates
// the user pointer with the `copy_from_user` / `copy_to_user`
// helpers, and returns a non-negative i64 on success or
// `FsError::Unsupported` (→ ENOTTY) for an unknown number.
//
// EBADF on closed fd; ENOTTY on a FileOps without an `ioctl` impl
// or on an unrecognised cmd — mirrors Linux's `do_vfs_ioctl`.

// ── Stat / Fstat ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `StatBuf` is the kernel-user wire-stable shape NARF surfaces today.
// It mirrors `narf_filesystem::Stat` minus the `Mode` enum (collapsed
// to a `u32` so the user side doesn't need to import `narf_filesystem`
// to read the result). This is *not* POSIX `struct stat`; the relibc
// shim translates as needed when a real POSIX `stat()` lands.

/// Wire-stable stat output. `mode` carries the FileType in the high
/// bits (POSIX-shaped: `0o100000` = file, `0o040000` = dir) and the
/// 9 perm bits in the low end, giving a consumer one word that
/// reads like a POSIX `st_mode`.

// through `FileOps::truncate` — read-only filesystems return
// `Unsupported`, which we surface as the wire `-1` sentinel.

// ── Pread / Pwrite — positional I/O without per-fd offset ─────────
//
// FileOps::read / write already take an offset arg; the regular
// sys_read / sys_write handlers walk through the per-fd cursor on
// top. pread / pwrite skip the cursor mutation — POSIX guarantees
// the per-fd offset is unchanged after these calls.

// ── Fallocate — preallocate file space ─────────────────────────────
//
// Linux fallocate(2) modes we honour:
//   - 0 (default)              : ensure file is >= offset + len.
//   - FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE 0x10: zero the given range; extend
//                                the file if it ends before
//                                offset + len.

// rejected — MemFs has no hole-tracking and the validate harness
// doesn't exercise them.

// ── CopyFileRange — chunked file→file copy ─────────────────────────
//
// Linux copy_file_range(2): in-kernel copy without bouncing the
// data through user memory. Real consumers (cp, rsync, GNU cat,
// container runtimes) prefer this over the read/write loop. NARF's
// MemFs has no special "copy without unmapping pages" path; we just
// read into a stack chunk and write it out.
//
// ABI (Linux, x86_64):
//   copy_file_range(int fd_in, loff_t *off_in,
//                   int fd_out, loff_t *off_out,
//                   size_t len, unsigned int flags)
// The offsets are POINTERS. NULL means "start at this fd's file
// offset and advance it by the copied count"; a non-NULL pointer
// means "start at *off, write back *off + copied, and leave the fd
// cursor alone". Getting this wrong is not subtle: glibc's `cat`
// issues `copy_file_range(3, NULL, 1, NULL, huge, 0)`, and reading
// the args in the old NARF-native `(fd_in, fd_out, off_in, off_out)`
// order decoded that as "read fd 3 from offset 1, write to fd 0",
// which dropped the first byte, sent the copy to stdin's device, and
// never advanced either offset — so `cat` looped forever.

// ── Truncate — path-based file resize ──────────────────────────────
//
// Linux truncate(2). Equivalent to open + ftruncate + close in one
// syscall. Resolves the absolute path to a FileOps and calls
// `truncate(len)` directly — no fd-table involvement. Routes to the
// same trait method that backs SYS_FTRUNCATE.

// ── unlinkat / mkdirat / renameat — *at-keyed FS mutation ─────────
//
// Each ignores dirfd, requires absolute paths, and routes through
// the existing SYS_UNLINK / SYS_RMDIR / SYS_MKDIR / SYS_RENAME
// handler bodies via the same Reshape proxy pattern as openat.
//
// unlinkat honours AT_REMOVEDIR (0x200) — when set, route to rmdir.

//
// Linux access(path, mode), chmod(path, mode), chown(path, uid, gid)
// — pre-*at calls that take a relative-or-absolute path with no
// directory fd. NARF treats them as faccessat / fchmodat / fchownat
// with `dirfd = AT_FDCWD` and forwards into the shared
// `sys_fchmodat_or_fchownat` body, which already enforces the
// "path must be absolute, mode/uid/gid bits ignored" contract.

//
// Linux newfstatat(dirfd, path, statbuf, flags). Same dirfd-
// ignored / path-must-be-absolute simplification. Re-shape args
// to the SYS_STAT signature (path_ptr, path_len, stat_out) and
// reuse sys_stat's body.

// 64-bit ns-precision timestamps and a request mask. The mask is
// advisory — Linux fills more than asked when cheap, fills less
// when the field isn't available, and reports what was filled in
// `stx_mask`. NARF's filesystem layer only carries size/blocks/
// mode/mtime_cycles, so we fill those plus type/ino, and set
// `stx_mask` to STATX_BASIC_STATS minus the fields we cannot
// produce (atime/ctime/uid/gid/nlink).
//
// Gated behind `linux-compat` so a NARF-only userspace doesn't
// pay the size cost of the layout assertion or pull in the

// ── openat — *at-keyed open ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Linux openat(dirfd, path, flags, mode) — modern replacement for
// open. dirfd is ignored (NARF has no directory-fd type); path
// must be absolute. The body re-shapes args into the SYS_OPEN
// signature (path_ptr, path_len, mount_ptr=0, mount_len=0, flags)
// and routes through the existing sys_open handler so the open
// path is identical.

// ── fchmodat / fchownat — *at-keyed mode/owner ─────────────────────
//
// NARF doesn't support directory fds, so the dirfd arg is
// ignored. Path must be absolute; if it resolves we report
// success (mode/uid/gid bits are structural-only state we don't
// enforce). Relative paths are rejected with -1 to keep the
// consumer's error-checking honest.

// ── fchmod / fchown — accept-and-ignore on known fd ───────────────
//
// NARF has no per-file permission bits or owner; the kernel
// surface exists so consumers (tar, cp, install) can round-trip
// the values without breaking. Both succeed for any open fd, fail
// (-1) for a closed/unknown fd.

// ── memfd_create — anonymous in-memory file ────────────────────────
//
// Linux memfd_create(2): mint a fresh in-memory file backed by a
// fresh (no directory entry) MemFile, install it in the caller's
// fd table, return the fd. The name is recorded for debug-only
// introspection; we don't preserve it in NARF today (no
// /proc-style listing). Real consumers (sandboxes, IPC, tmpfile)
// rely on the surface alone.

// in `[read, write]` order (matching POSIX `int pipefd[2]`).

// ── Pipe2 — pipe + atomic flag set ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Linux pipe2(2): same as pipe but the second arg sets per-fd
// flags atomically with the install. We honour O_CLOEXEC by
// stamping FD_CLOEXEC on both halves; O_NONBLOCK is accepted and
// ignored (NARF pipe reads short-return on empty already, no
// blocking model to toggle).

// reported by the FileOps `stat()`. Negative resulting offsets are

// FSes that haven't overridden the trait default surface

//   d_reclen: u16    — total record length, 8-byte aligned
//   d_type:   u8
//   d_name:  [u8]    — NUL-terminated, padded to alignment
//
// Total record size: round_up_8(19 + name_len + 1).

// ── Getdents — legacy fd-based directory read (linux_dirent) ───────
//
// Linux ABI: `getdents(unsigned int fd, void *dirp, unsigned int
// count)` — x86_64 78. The aarch64 / generic ABI does NOT expose the
// legacy `getdents` (only `getdents64`, 61), so there is no aarch64
// wire number for it; libc on that arch always issues getdents64.
//
// This is the pre-largefile twin of [[sys_getdents64]] — same
// directory-resolution + enumerate + cursor logic, only the per-record
// serialisation differs. The legacy `struct linux_dirent`:
//   d_ino:    unsigned long (u64 on LP64)
//   d_off:    unsigned long (u64) — cursor of the *next* entry
//   d_reclen: unsigned short (u16) — total record length, 8-byte aligned
//   d_name:  [u8]                  — NUL-terminated
//   <zero pad>
//   d_type:   u8                   — stored at the LAST byte (reclen-1)
//
// Note the d_type placement: unlike getdents64 (which has an explicit
// d_type field at offset 18), the legacy record hides d_type in the pad
// byte at `buf[offset + d_reclen - 1]`, and there is always a NUL after
// the name before that pad/d_type byte. Total record size therefore
// rounds up `18 (header) + name_len + 1 (NUL) + 1 (d_type)` to 8.
//
// EBADF / ENOTDIR / return-bytes semantics match sys_getdents64.

// `default_sync_signal_delivery` when a pending signal has no installed
// user handler and the POSIX default action is Terminate / CoreDump.
//
// Behaviour:
//   - When a UserTaskFuture is in flight (the normal user-mode case),
//     save user state, mark EXIT_REASON_EXITED, tail-call the exit hook
//     → longjmps back into UserTaskFuture::poll → fans out exit
//     observers → on_child_exit drains the staged wstatus into the
//     parent's pending-exits queue.
//   - Without a polling future installed (kernel-only test contexts),
//     the staged wstatus is still recorded and we mark the syscall's
//     return as Ok(0); test harnesses fire `notify_task_exited`
//     manually.
/// The answer a memory syscall gives when it finds no address space to
/// operate on.
///
/// Every one of `mmap`/`munmap`/`mprotect`/`mremap`/`madvise`/`mlock*`/
/// `munlock*`/`mincore`/`mbind`/`migrate_pages`/`move_pages`/
/// `pkey_mprotect`/`process_madvise` used to answer this with
/// `SyscallReturn::invalid_op()`, whose `value` — the register the Linux ABI
/// returns — is 0. Every one of them therefore reported that an operation
/// which did not happen had succeeded. For most that is merely a lie; for

// ── Yield — cooperative scheduler hand-back ────────────────────────

// ── restart_syscall — kernel-injected syscall continuation ─────────
//
// Linux ABI: `restart_syscall(void)` — x86_64 219 / aarch64 128. It is
// NOT meant to be called by userspace directly; the kernel injects it
// (rewriting the trap's syscall number) to resume a blocking syscall
// that was interrupted by a signal whose handler ran, when that syscall
// needs an *absolute* rearm point that a plain SA_RESTART RIP-rewind
// would corrupt (e.g. a relative `nanosleep` that must resume with the
// remaining, not the original, timeout). Linux backs this with a
// per-task `restart_block` (`current->restart_block.fn`) that points at
// the specific resume routine; when nothing set one, the block points
// at `do_no_restart_syscall`, which simply returns -EINTR.
//
// NARF's restart model has NO per-task restart_block. SA_RESTART is
// implemented purely by REWINDING the user RIP by 2 (the `syscall`
// instruction width) in `deliver_signal_into_state`
// (`state.rip.wrapping_sub(2)` — see syscall.rs), so an interrupted
// restartable syscall simply re-executes its original trap from scratch;
// the blocking syscalls that must not re-arm from scratch (nanosleep,
// clock_nanosleep, ...) are excluded from the restartable set in
// `is_restartable_syscall` and instead surface -EINTR / an abbreviated
// result to userspace. There is therefore no saved syscall to
// re-invoke here.
//
// We faithfully mirror Linux's no-restart-block case: `restart_syscall`
// with nothing pending returns -EINTR (errno 4), exactly as
// `do_no_restart_syscall` does. This keeps the wire number dispatchable
// (so a libc that emits it, or a trace replay, sees the canonical
// result) without inventing a restart-block subsystem that NARF's
// RIP-rewind model does not need.

// ── RingKick — drain the shared SQ, post completions to the CQ ────

//
// Wave-65. Gated behind the `linux-compat` crate feature so non-
// Linux-shaped consumers (the testbin runner, kernel-internal task
// shapes) don't pull in the per-thread bookkeeping below.
//
// clone3(2) takes a single user pointer to `struct clone_args`
// (Linux kernel uapi/linux/sched.h). The kernel reads the flags +
// stack + tls + tid-pointer fields and routes:
//
//   - CLONE_VM       child shares parent's Arc<AddressSpace>.
//   - CLONE_THREAD   child joins the parent's thread group; its
//                    user-visible TGID is the parent's, while its
//                    TID is a fresh scheduler TaskId. Without this
//                    bit the child is treated as a process (fresh
//                    ProcessId allocation).
//   - CLONE_FS       cwd table shared (skip cwd_fork).
//   - CLONE_FILES    fd table shared (skip fd::fork).
//   - CLONE_SIGHAND  sigaction table shared (skip sigaction_fork).
//   - CLONE_SETTLS   args.tls programmed into the architecture's user TLS
//                    register on first dispatch (IA32_FS_BASE / TPIDR_EL0).
//   - CLONE_PARENT_SETTID writes the child TID into *args.parent_tid.
//   - CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID stashes args.child_tid in a per-task slot;
//                    on thread exit, the kernel writes 0 there and
//                    FUTEX_WAKEs one waiter.
//

// against the duplicate. The child's first poll calls
// `enter_user_mode_resume` against a snapshot of the parent's
// trap frame with `rax = 0`, so the child wakes up at the
// instruction *after* its `int 0x80` and reads the POSIX "child
// got 0 from fork()" return value. Returns the child's tid to
// the parent.
//
// Inheritance: AS (copied), fd table (copied via `fd::fork`), cwd
// (copied via `cwd_fork`), brk (inherited on the AS by `clone_for_fork`), sigaction
// handlers (copied via `sigaction_fork`), trap-frame state (copied
// via `TrapContext::save_user_state`, with rax mutated to 0 in
// the child).
//
// COW: `clone_for_fork` shares the parent's frames with the
// child via `narf_memory::frame::cow::inc_ref` and strips WRITE
// on both regions. The first user-mode write faults; the trap
// handler in `frame::<arch>::trap` calls `cow_split_on_write` +
// `remap_page` to allocate a private frame, memcpy the bytes,
// and restore WRITE on the faulting AS. Large brk heaps no
// longer pay an up-front memcpy at fork time.

/// Legacy FIFO wake bridge. A named-pipe read or write changes the buffer state,

// One master teardown for every tid-keyed table, run from the exit-
// observer fan-out. Before this existed, cleanup was bolted on
// table-by-table and ~40 tables were missed entirely — every exited
// task leaked its signal state, credentials, cwd, scheduling params,
// wakers, and timers forever (tids are monotonic, so nothing ever
// overwrote the stale rows), and pid-keyed leftovers were actively
// dangerous once the pid recycled.
//
// Tables deliberately NOT swept here:
//   - CLEAR_CHILD_TID       — `fire_clear_child_tid_on_exit` takes it
//                             (observer order must not matter),
//   - TASK_STOPPED          — on_child_exit already removes it,
//   - PENDING_TERMINATION   — drained by on_child_exit (wstatus),
//   - TASK_CPU_NS/CHILD     — needed at reap (account_reaped_child),
//   - PID_TO_TASK/TASK_TO_PID — needed through the zombie window,
//                             removed at reap (release_reaped_task),
//   - fd table              — fd::detach (on_child_exit) owns it.

// valued in TaskId). But `getpid()` reports the *visible* pid
// (task→ProcessId, then PID-namespace translation) — see `sys_getpid`.
// So when a process does `tcsetpgrp(getpid())` / `setpgid` / reads

// table is a task id. Under the `container` feature those two spaces
// diverge (e.g. getty task 14 ↔ visible pid 2), and the mismatch makes
// `tty_background_access` see a foreground leader as "background" and
// SIGTTIN-stop it — which hung getty at the login read.

// `narf_filesystem::posix_access_ok` is the discretionary check on a
// single inode, and `sys_open` / `access(2)` already use it. What was
// missing is Linux's check on the PATH: `link_path_walk` requires
// MAY_EXEC (search) on every directory it traverses, which is what makes
// a 0700 directory actually hide its contents from other users. Without
// it, a caller who could not open the directory could still stat straight
// through it to a file inside.

/// Does `task` hold search (MAY_EXEC) permission on the directory at
/// `path`? Built on the same `posix_access_ok` the open path uses, so
/// there is one DAC algorithm in the tree rather than two.
/// `kernel/capability.c::capable_wrt_inode_uidgid` — a DAC override
/// applies only to an inode whose owners are MAPPED in the caller's user
/// namespace:

/// /* ... which is kuid_has_mapping(ns, i_uid) && kgid_has_mapping(ns, i_gid) */
/// ```
///
/// This is not a refinement, it is the whole containment property. A task
/// that is root INSIDE a user namespace holds the full capability set
/// there; without the mapping test that capability would also override DAC
/// on HOST files the namespace has no view of, and unprivileged user
/// namespaces would be a way to read /etc/shadow. The previous `uid == 0`

// ── Yield / Sleep — Ok ─────────────────────────────────────────────

// ── Sleep ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Syscall::Sleep` carries the requested sleep in nanoseconds in
// `arg0`. Two paths:
//
//   1. Polling-future path (the normal case for `UserTaskFuture`-
//      driven user tasks): stash an absolute deadline on the
//      current `UserTaskCtx`, mark the saved RAX = 0, save the
//      user state, and longjmp back into the polling routine
//      with `EXIT_REASON_YIELDED`. The next poll observes the
//      deadline, returns `Pending` until it expires, and only
//      then re-enters user mode at the post-syscall instruction.
//      This frees the executor to round-robin other ready tasks
//      while the sleeper is parked.
//   2. Fallback busy-wait (test trampolines / pre-polling-future
//      contexts): spin until monotonic_ns advances past the
//      deadline, ticking registered sleep_pumps so background
//      kernel work makes forward progress.
// ── GetRandom — arg0=buf, arg1=len, arg2=flags(ignored) ─────────────
//
// Fill the caller's user-mode buffer with random bytes. Stage-4
// backing is a Park-Miller LCG seeded from monotonic_ns() — NOT
// cryptographically secure (matches `crypto::per_task_rng`'s seed
// quality, which carries the same caveat). When `arch/` exposes a
// HW entropy probe (RDSEED on x86_64, RNDR on aarch64), the seed
// path here gets replaced.
//
// The Park-Miller LCG and the raw RDRAND/RDSEED helpers that used to back
// `getrandom(2)` lived here. They are gone: `sys_getrandom` now draws from
// `narf_filesystem::csprng`, the ChaCha20 pool that also backs /dev/random
// and /dev/urandom and that already prefers RDSEED/RDRAND on x86_64 and
// RNDRRS/RNDR on aarch64. Keeping a second, weaker generator around is how
// the LCG ended up serving getrandom on aarch64 in the first place.

/// Registry of "background-work" callbacks that run inside the
/// `sys_sleep` busy-wait. Subsystems whose forward progress is
/// gated on the scheduler's polling tick — chiefly the FB drain
/// task — register a pump here at boot so their work continues
/// even while a user task is sleeping.
///
/// Re-export of the canonical sleep-pump registry, which lives in
/// narf-scheduler so driver crates can call `run()` from sync spin
/// loops without depending on narf-userspace. Existing call sites
/// (`sys_sleep`'s busy-wait + the FB drain pump registration)
/// continue to use `narf_userspace::handlers::sleep_pumps`.
