//! Linux syscall ABI conformance — the user/kernel address boundary that
//! every `copy_to_user` / `copy_from_user` call site inherits.
//!
//! `validate_user_range` is the single choke point for ~180 `copy_to_user`
//! sites and every `copy_from_user` site in this crate. Until this file
//! existed it accepted canonical *kernel-half* addresses on the theory that
//! SMAP would stop the access. It does not: SMAP faults a CPL-0 touch of a
//! page with `PTE.U=1`, says nothing about a kernel page (`U=0`), and
//! `copy_user_guarded` runs the whole transfer inside a `STAC`/`CLAC`
//! bracket that disables it outright. A mapped kernel destination was
//! written silently and the caller got `Ok(())` — an arbitrary-kernel-write
//! primitive out of any syscall with a caller-supplied (address, length,
//! content) triple.
//!
//! What lives here:
//!
//!  * the boundary predicate itself, positive and negative, with the
//!    last-byte cases that a first-byte-only check would pass;
//!  * the demonstrated `bpf(BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD)` BTF gadget, end to
//!    end, asserting both the errno *and* that the kernel bytes the copy
//!    would have landed on are untouched;
//!  * the `btf_log_buf` variant of the same primitive;
//!  * the read direction (`copy_from_user` from a kernel source is an
//!    info leak, not just a write hazard);
//!  * proof that the `kernel-test` opt-in is dynamically scoped — it
//!    closes when its scope does, which is what keeps every other test in
//!    the suite exercising the production predicate.
