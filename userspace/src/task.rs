//! Refcounted task lifetime — NARF's `task_struct`.
//!
//! Linux mapping: `Arc<Task>` ≙ `task_struct` + its refcount
//! (`get_task_struct`/`put_task_struct` ≙ `Arc::clone`/drop);
//! [`TASKS`] ≙ the pid table (holds one ref while the task is
//! findable); [`release_task`] ≙ `release_task()`.
//!
//! Lifetime rules (see `docs/TASK_LIFETIME_REDESIGN.md`):
//!
//! 1. `TASKS` holds exactly one `Arc` from spawn registration until
//!    the task is reaped ([`release_task`]). Any holder that needs the
//!    task beyond a lock section clones the `Arc` — dereferencing NEVER
//!    requires holding the registry lock. This replaces the old
//!    `USER_TASK_CTXS` raw-`*mut UserTaskCtx` registry whose safety
//!    hung on a deref-under-lock convention.
//! 2. The task's `UserTaskFuture` holds an `Arc<Task>` for its whole
//!    life, so the executor dropping the slot is a ref-put, not a free
//!    — and the `UserTaskCtx` address stays stable (and valid) for
//!    every raw self-pointer the in-flight trap/syscall paths hold.
//! 3. Exit marks the task [`TASK_ZOMBIE`] (it stays findable, carrying
//!    its exit code, until the parent reaps). Reaping removes the
//!    registry ref; the memory is freed when the LAST `Arc` drops.
//! 4. IRQ contexts must never drop an `Arc<Task>` (NARF forbids
//!    allocator frees in IRQ context — the `deferred_wake` rule). IRQ
//!    paths keep operating on tids + `Arc<WakeCell>` wakers only.

// the park census runs out. It says the task is computing, not stalled,
// and nothing about WHAT. The timer trap already captures the interrupted
// RIP on every tick, so a histogram of that RIP — sampled only while the
// target task is in CPL 3 — is a profiler for free.
//
// Open-addressed, fixed-size, alloc-free: this runs in IRQ context on
// every tick, where NARF forbids allocator calls. A full table drops
// samples and says so rather than growing.

/// Number of distinct RIPs the profile can hold. Power of two — the

/// so its `epoll_wait_fd` is never set and it never appears there.
///
/// A ready fd on a "parked" task is NOT by itself evidence of a strand,
/// and `park_checks` does not make it one. `parked_in_syscall` is set
/// before the park but cleared only at syscall EXIT, so a task cycling
/// park → wake → re-execute → scan → park reads as parked for the whole
/// duration of a healthy blocking poll — with `park_checks` climbing
/// ~100/s off the backstop the entire time. Sampling a ready fd anywhere
/// in that window reports a WORKING compositor as stranded, which is
/// exactly what this probe did before the latch below existed.
///
/// `scans` is the discriminator, applied as a two-sample latch (see
/// [`crate::user_task::UserTaskCtx::dbg_poll_strand_latch`]): a task is
/// reported only if it is seen twice with a ready fd and has NOT re-run
/// its own `poll_common` readiness scan in between. A healthy poller
/// re-scans within one ~10 ms backstop, so a full watchdog interval
/// without one means the syscall genuinely never re-executes.
///
/// `park_checks` is still printed, but as a SECONDARY split of a
/// confirmed strand: climbing means the park loop reconsiders the task
/// and the stay-parked decision is wrong; frozen means the task is never
/// reconsidered at all — a lost wake. Those need opposite fixes.
///
/// The trailing fields discriminate WHICH park a frozen task is actually
/// in — `dbg_park_checks` only counts `park_should_block` /
/// `UserTaskFuture::poll` passes, and two park sites bypass both the
/// counter and the ~10 ms wheel backstop entirely:
///   * `wait_child_pending` — the task parked through
///     `own_stack_wait_child` (wait-child + signal waker only; no wheel
///     slot, no io waiter, no counter bump). A ppoll that reaches
///     `own_stack_block` with this flag stale-true is misrouted there.
///   * `stopped` — the task parked through `park_should_block`'s
///     job-stop arm (signal waker only; no wheel slot by design).
///   * `deadline_ns`/`net_io_wait` — a healthy deadline-arm park shows
///     `deadline != 0` + `net_io_wait == true` (io waiter + wheel
///     backstop armed). `deadline == 0` while parked means a
///     `wake_one` consumed the park state but the executor never
///     re-polled the slot — an executor/queue-side lost wake.
///   * `scans` — how many readiness passes this task's OWN poll park has
///     run (`UserTaskCtx::dbg_poll_scans`). Sample it twice: advancing
///     while an fd stays ready means `poll_scan` and this scan disagree
///     about the same fd; frozen means the syscall never re-executes.
///     `park_checks` cannot answer this — it climbs in both cases.
