//! User-process bundle.
//!
//! `UserProcess` is everything the kernel needs to actually run a
//! loaded ELF: the address space, the entry point, a freshly-
//! allocated user stack (mapped into the AS with R+W+U perms), and
//! the monotonic `ProcessId`. `load_user_process(bytes)` is the
//! one-shot wrapper around `load_elf_bytes` that also carves out
//! the user stack.
//!
//! Once you have a `UserProcess` the remaining steps to run it are:
//! 1. `proc.address_space.activate()` — MOV CR3 to its PML4.
//! 2. `enter_user_mode(proc.entry.0.raw(), proc.stack_top.as_u64())`
//!    — iretq into user.
//! 3. Register syscall handlers (the core set lives in
//!    `handlers::install_core_syscalls`) so `int 0x80` from the
//!    running user program routes into the kernel.

// When the in-memory `interp::` registry misses, we read the
// interpreter from the VFS. The mount the path lives under is
// whatever `registry().resolve_absolute` finds — initramfs at "/"
// covers `/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1` once the CPIO stages it there.
//
// The narf-filesystem API is async; each future is pumped with
// `handlers::poll_io_to_completion` (huge backstop, never drops the
// future mid-flight). A small bounded budget here used to overrun
// whenever the interp read contended with other block I/O — a
// fork+exec loop plus journal writes was enough — and the overrun
// ALSO dropped the in-flight read future, leaving its virtio-blk
// request DMA'ing into a recycled scratch buffer. The resulting
// `None` then silently loaded the program with NO interpreter,
// which crashed it at rip=0 (see `ProcessLoadError::InterpUnavailable`).

/// Read `abs_path` (a POSIX-style absolute path like
/// `/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1`) through the VFS into an owned byte
/// vector. Returns `None` when the path doesn't resolve, the file
/// is empty, the read exceeds 64 MiB (defensive cap — a sane ld-musl
/// is <200 KiB), or any read short-circuits with `FsError`.
