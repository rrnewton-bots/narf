//! Syscall table + dispatch.
//!
//! Spec: `userspace/specification/spec.md` + `abi/specification/spec.md`
//! §3. relibc enters the kernel via a platform-specific instruction
//! (`syscall` on x86_64, `svc #0` on aarch64). The arch trap entry
//! (in `frame/`) saves registers, reads the syscall number + args
//! out of the saved frame, and calls `kernel_syscall_entry(num, args)`
//! below. The asm stub has not landed yet on either arch — it's the
//! one remaining deep piece between this surface and running a user
//! binary — but the Rust-side dispatch is complete and tested
//! independently.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//! 1. Each subsystem calls `SyscallTable::install(n, handler)` for
//!    the syscalls it implements at boot.
//! 2. `install_global(table)` publishes the assembled table as the
//!    kernel-wide dispatcher.
//! 3. The arch trap stub (once it lands) calls
//!    `kernel_syscall_entry(num, args)`.
//! 4. `kernel_syscall_entry` consults the global table, routes to
//!    the registered handler, and returns a `SyscallReturn`.
//!
//! Unregistered numbers surface `NarfStatus::InvalidOp` (value =
//! 1 on the wire — `InvalidOp` discriminant in `abi::NarfStatus`).

// ── TrapContext trait ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Arch-neutral view onto the arch-specific TrapFrame for syscalls.
// The arch trap handler constructs an impl of this trait around its
// TrapFrame + extracted args, then calls `kernel_syscall_entry(num,
// &mut ctx)`. Raw handlers receive `&mut dyn TrapContext` and can
// both read args and write the return — plus `redirect_to_kernel`
// for handlers that want to unwind into kernel state instead of
// iretq-ing back to user (e.g. cleanup-and-exit paths).

/// `SyscallHandler`s only see `args()`; raw handlers see the full
