//! User-task polling-future glue.
//!
//! Stage-4 piece that lets a user-mode task live as a
//! `Future<Output = ()>` on the scheduler's run queue. The polling
//! contract:
//!
//! 1. The future owns a `UserTaskCtx` — a `UserState` slot for the
//!    saved CPU state plus a kernel-side `JmpBuf` for the
//!    polling-routine's setjmp.
//! 2. `poll(cx)` calls setjmp; when setjmp returns 0 the routine
//!    either does the first-time `enter_user_mode(entry, stack)`
//!    or, on a re-poll, calls `enter_user_mode_resume(&state)`.
//!    Both never return — control reaches user mode.
//! 3. When the user issues a "yield-to-scheduler" syscall (Yield
//!    or any future await-style op), the trap handler:
//!      - calls `TrapContext::save_user_state` against the
//!        current task's `UserState`,
//!      - longjmps back into the polling routine with a sentinel
//!        marking why control returned (yielded / exited / etc.).
//! 4. The trap handler finds the calling task's UserTaskCtx via
//!    [`current_user_task`] — a single static slot the polling
//!    routine populates on entry. Single-CPU cooperative for now;
//!    SMP gets a per-CPU slot when that lands.
//!
//! `UserTaskFuture` itself is left to the caller — the future
//! shape depends on what wakers need to fire (immediate cooperative
//! Yield vs timer wake vs ring-completion wake). This module
//! provides the building blocks; tests / the scheduler-spawn path
//! wire them together.

// ── Per-task-own-stack syscall park ─────────────────────────────────
//
// In the own-stack model a blocking syscall does NOT longjmp back to the
// poll's trap-back half (that half no longer runs — the poll diverges on first
// entry). Instead the handler sets its park state + rewinds RIP exactly as
// before, then calls `own_stack_park()`, which registers the task's executor
// slot-`Waker` (so the event source re-polls us) and `kernel_switch`es out via
// `yield_current_stackful`. On resume it RE-CHECKS the condition (a spurious or
// early wake re-parks) and only returns once the condition clears — then the
// caller returns and the sysret tail re-executes the syscall at the rewound RIP
// (the same "re-execute on wake" contract the longjmp path had). This is the
// relocation of the poll dispatch's waker-registration to the park site; it
// mirrors `UserTaskFuture::poll`'s sleep/futex/io/console/signal-stop arms but
// uses the slot-waker instead of `cx.waker()`. wait4 is NOT handled here (it
// returns a reaped result, not a re-execute) — that handler parks natively.

/// Register `waker` with the park condition's event source and report whether
/// the task should actually block (`true`) or proceed/re-execute now (`false`,
/// condition already satisfied or a wake raced us). Mirrors the poll dispatch.
///
/// Every `false` return leaves the park and returns the task to userspace, so
/// it drops ALL of the task's futex registrations through the per-task index
/// (`futex_park_leave`, the same removal algorithm task exit uses). Doing it
/// here, around the whole decision, covers every exit — deadline, signal,
/// wake, the wheel-saturation bail-out, and the non-futex early returns —
/// without trusting `futex_uaddr`, which a requeue rewrites only after it has

// ── UserTaskFuture ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The Stage-4 polling-future that lets a user-mode task ride the
// scheduler's ready queue. Each `poll`:
//   1. installs `&mut self.ctx` as the current user-task slot,
//   2. publishes `&mut self.jmp` via `CURRENT_JMP` so the static
//      yield/exit hooks (registered once at boot) can reach it,
//   3. snapshots kernel CR3 + clears IF,
//   4. setjmps. Returning 0 → enter or resume user mode (never
//      returns). Returning a non-zero longjmp value → a hook fired,
//      we map it to Yielded → Pending or Exited → Ready(()).
//
// The hooks are static fn pointers; both call `longjmp(CURRENT_JMP,
// reason)`. Single-CPU cooperative executor → exactly one task is
// in flight at any time → a single global `AtomicPtr<JmpBuf>` slot
// is sufficient. SMP bring-up will swap this for a per-CPU slot.
