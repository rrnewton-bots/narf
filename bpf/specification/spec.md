# `bpf/` — specification

## 1. Purpose & scope

In-kernel BPF: a verified, JIT-compiled, sandboxed execution environment for
programs supplied at runtime by userspace.

NARF's BPF is **instruction-set compatible with Linux and ABI-divergent**. The
instruction encoding is Linux's verbatim, because LLVM's `bpf` target is our
compiler and rewriting the encoding would mean writing a backend. Everything
above the encoding — the data model, memory model, call ABI, and verification
strategy — is designed here rather than inherited.

For scale: Linux's BPF is ~83.5k LOC in `kernel/bpf/` plus ~40k across arch
JITs plus 12.6k in `net/core/filter.c`; `verifier.c` alone is 26,199 lines.
Roughly half of that is accreted complexity, and §8 of `research/README.md`
enumerates which half and why.

**In scope:** the verifier, the JIT, arenas and maps, the kfunc and struct_ops
extension mechanisms, and four attach surfaces (tracing/fentry, struct_ops,
net classifier, perf).

**Out of scope, permanently:** helper calls (we have one call ABI), `LD_ABS`/
`LD_IND`, unprivileged BPF, and Linux's map-type zoo beyond the five native
kinds in §3.4.

**Out of scope, for now:** offloaded programs, CO-RE relocation in-kernel (it
is a userspace concern), and continuation-style JIT lowering of sleepable
programs (§8.5).

## 2. Assumptions

1. **The instruction encoding is fixed.** Including its warts: `off` selecting
   the `SDIV`/`SMOD`/`MOVSX` variants and `ADDR_SPACE_CAST`; atomic operations
   living in `imm` with two of them (`BPF_LOAD_ACQ`, `BPF_STORE_REL`) too wide
   for eight bits; `src_reg` selecting seven `LD_IMM64` pseudo-forms and three
   kinds of call.
2. **Programs are hostile.** Every guarantee is enforced, never assumed.
3. **`alloc` is available**, but a *running* program may not use it — see §4.6.
4. **The kernel address space is NX outside kernel text, but not read-only.**
   `memory/src/x86_64/mmu.rs` now builds every window — low identity, high
   MMIO, kernel direct map, and the higher-half kernel window — with
   `NO_EXEC`, demoting 1 GiB leaves to 2 MiB and 4 KiB where a narrower
   exception is needed; `frame/src/aarch64/boot.S` does the same with
   `PXN|UXN`. The only executable ranges are `[__kernel_start, __text_end)`
   and the 8 KiB AP-trampoline window at physical `0x8000`. JIT text is
   therefore no longer *aliased RWX* — but the alias is still **writable**,
   so an arbitrary kernel write can still overwrite live JIT text. See §4.2.
5. **BPF kernel-VA slots must exist before the first user address space.**
   `new_user_pml4_on` (`memory/src/x86_64/paging.rs:239`) snapshot-copies
   PML4[256..511] *by value*, and nothing propagates later changes. See §4.1.

## 3. Public interface

### 3.1 Crates

| Crate | Contents | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| `narf-bpf-isa` | instruction encode/decode/disasm | none |
| `narf-bpf-verifier` | type graph, IR, abstract interpretation | `isa` |
| `narf-bpf-jit` | x86_64 and aarch64 emitters | `isa`, `verifier` |
| `narf-bpf` | kernel runtime, `kfunc!`/`struct_ops!`, attach adapters | the above + kernel crates |
| `narf-bpf-leds` | atomic LED-command kfunc + worker-registration seam | `narf-bpf`, `narf-drivers-leds`, `narf-init` |

The first three are dependency-free of the kernel and host-testable via
`cargo xtask host-test`. `narf-bpf` must **not** depend on `narf-userspace` —
that would be a cycle. The `bpf(2)` handler lives in `narf-userspace`, which
depends on `narf-bpf`.

`narf-bpf-bench` serial output uses grammar version 2. Each record publishes
both its collected `n` and benchmark-declared `target_n`; an operator override
may raise but never lower that target. Value chunks carry their starting sample
index and terminate in a record/skip count marker consumed by `cargo xtask
bpf-bench`.

### 3.2 The kfunc contract

`narf_bpf_verifier::kfunc` — `KfuncDesc`, `ArgDesc`, `ValidityDomain`,
`PtrKind`, `Context`. Argument semantics are derived from Rust types by the
`kfunc!` macro through a `BpfType` trait:

| Rust type | Meaning | Linux equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `u32`/`u64`/`i64` | scalar | plain arg |
| `Trusted<T>` | trusted non-null pointer, dies at an await | `PTR_TRUSTED` |
| `Owned<T>` (return) | acquires a reference | `KF_ACQUIRE` |
| `Owned<T>` (argument) | releases it; consumed | `KF_RELEASE` |
| `Option<T>` | nullable; must be tested | `KF_RET_NULL` / `__nullable` |
| `Rcu<'g, T>` | QSBR-domain; dies at an await | `KF_RCU` / `MEM_RCU` |
| `SleepableRcu<'g, T>` | survives awaits; needs `Cap<SleepableReader>` | `KF_RCU_PROTECTED` |
| `&[u8]` | pointer + length pair | `__sz` |
| `&mut MaybeUninit<T>` | callee initialises | `__uninit` |
| `ArenaPtr<T>` | arena-space pointer | `KF_ARENA_ARG*` |
| `Const<N>` | verified constant | `__k` |
| `Guard<'_>` | critical-section guard; linear, never sleep-safe | `bpf_spin_lock` |

Descriptors go into a `narf.kfuncs` link section, collected at boot exactly as
`narf-kernel-test` collects `narf.tests`.

#### LED command kfunc

`narf_led_submit(idx: u32, action: u32, value: u32) -> i64` is an
`Atomic` kfunc provided by `narf-bpf-leds`. Actions are brightness (0),
blink (1, `on_ms << 16 | off_ms`), off (2), and RGB color (3,
`0x00RRGGBB`). It returns 0 after enqueue, -EAGAIN when the bounded mailbox
cannot accept the command, and -EINVAL for an unknown action. Device lookup and
hardware access occur only in the `Stage::Late` worker: the kfunc itself does
not allocate, lock, sleep, or dereference driver state, preserving §4.6. An
out-of-range device index is retained at full `u32` width and becomes a
drain-time no-op.

### 3.3 Memory-subsystem interface (Stream B)

```rust
// memory/src/bpf_text.rs — executable kernel text
pub struct Jit;                       // CapType, CapKind::Jit
pub type JitCap = Cap<Jit, Grant>;

pub fn reserve_kernel_slots() -> Result<(), TextError>;   // §4.1, boot-order critical
pub fn slots_reserved() -> bool;                          // what §4.1's debug_assert reads
pub fn alloc(cap: &JitCap, len: usize, node: usize) -> Result<TextAlloc, TextError>;
pub fn write(a: &TextAlloc, off: usize, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<(), TextError>;
pub fn seal(cap: &JitCap, a: &TextAlloc) -> Result<(), TextError>;
pub fn free(a: TextAlloc);            // quarantine, then the reclaim hook
pub fn reclaim(a: TextAlloc);         // call only after a grace period
pub fn install_reclaim_hook(h: fn(TextAlloc));
pub fn stats() -> (usize, usize, usize);   // (packs, chunks used, quarantined)
```

`write` goes through the identity alias, so it is legal before *and* after
`seal` (§4.2). `narf-memory` cannot depend on `narf-rcu` — the dependency graph
already runs `rcu → time → console → memory` — so the RCU grace period arrives
through `install_reclaim_hook`, the same seam shape as `install_pager`.

```rust
// memory/src/bpf_arena.rs — the program heap
pub struct BpfArena;                  // CapType, CapKind::BpfArena
impl Arena {
    pub fn new(cap: &ArenaCap, max_pages: usize) -> Result<Arena, ArenaError>;
    pub fn kva(&self) -> u64;                              // stable for the arena's life
    pub fn window_offset(&self) -> u64;                    // the base-relative pointer
    pub fn populate(&self, page: usize) -> Result<ArenaPage, ArenaError>;   // { kva, phys }
    pub fn populate_range(&self, from: usize, count: usize) -> Result<(), ArenaError>;
    pub fn first_unpopulated(&self, from: usize) -> Option<usize>;
    pub fn frame_at(&self, page: usize) -> Option<PhysAddr>;   // never populates
    pub fn resolve(&self, offset: u64) -> Option<u64>;
}
```

```rust
// memory/src/bpf_extable.rs — recoverable fault sites
pub struct ExEntry { pub fault_pc: u64, pub fixup_pc: u64, pub dst: GpReg }
pub fn register_image(token: u64, base: u64, end: u64, e: Vec<ExEntry>) -> Result<(), ExError>;
pub fn unregister_image(token: u64);
pub fn try_recover(fault_pc: u64) -> Option<Recovery>;     // called from both trap handlers
```

`GpReg` is the *architectural* register number the JIT already emitted —
0..=15 in x86_64's ModRM/REX encoding, 0..=30 for aarch64's `x0..x30` — so no
translation table exists to drift.

```rust
// memory/src/bpf_stack.rs — the per-CPU atomic-program stack
pub const STACK_BYTES: u64;  pub const MAX_NEST: u32;
pub fn init(cpus: usize) -> Result<(), StackError>;
pub fn try_enter() -> Option<StackLease>;   // None ⇒ decline the program
pub const fn bytes_per_level() -> u64;      // the verifier's stack bound
```

`StackLease` is `!Send` and releases its recorded origin CPU's atomic nesting
slot on drop, so preemption cannot double-lease a slice. On x86_64 PKS systems,
the mapped stack leaves carry `DomainId::BPF` in their PTE protection-key field;
FRAME-neutral execution and BPF confinement can access them, while unrelated
confined domains cannot. Sleepable programs use a future-owned heap stack
instead (§4.8), so this is not the only path.

```rust
// bpf/src/domain.rs — execution confinement
pub fn enter() -> Confined; // CPU-local, !Send + preempt-disabled atomic scope
pub async fn run_sleepable<F: Future>(future: F) -> F::Output;
```

`Confined` contains the scheduler's nestable preemption guard, so an arbitrary
stackful tick cannot migrate a live CPU-local snapshot. `run_sleepable` enters
and exits around each poll and never carries either guard across an `.await`.

```rust
// memory/src/wx.rs — the W^X capability gate
pub fn jit_grants_init();
pub fn grant_jit(task: u64) -> JitCap;      // idempotent per task
pub fn jit_cap(task: u64) -> Option<JitCap>;
pub fn revoke_jit(task: u64);               // wired to the thread exit-observer fan-out
pub fn jit_mprotect(cap: &JitCap, space: &AddressSpace,
                    base: VirtAddr, len: u64, new: RegionPerms) -> Result<(), WxError>;
```

`jit_mprotect` is the only path by which a `W | X` user mapping can come into
existence. `AddressSpace::mprotect_range` keeps rejecting `W | X` outright and
stays the cap-free fast path.

### 3.4 Maps

Five native kinds behind a 9-method trait: `Array`, `Hash`, `PerCpuArray`,
`PerCpuHash`, `RingBuf`. Everything else Linux makes a map type — LRU, LPM
tries, bloom filters, queues/stacks, map-in-map, and the graph data-structure
API — is an arena + kfunc library here, not kernel code.

`BPF_MAP_LOOKUP_AND_DELETE_ELEM` is one map operation, not a userspace-visible
lookup followed by delete: Hash and PerCpuHash copy the full syscall-width
value and unlink the node under the same map lock. Arrays and RingBuf return
`EOPNOTSUPP`, matching Linux's map-type restriction. NARF has no
BTF-described `bpf_spin_lock` values, so `BPF_F_LOCK` is `EINVAL`. The syscall
removes the entry before copying the result to userspace; an output `EFAULT`
therefore may consume the key without returning its value, as on Linux.

Each `MapFile` carries descriptor-local `ReadWrite`, `ReadOnly`, or `WriteOnly`
syscall access. `BPF_MAP_CREATE`, `BPF_OBJ_GET`, and
`BPF_MAP_GET_FD_BY_ID` accept Linux's mutually-exclusive `BPF_F_RDONLY` /
`BPF_F_WRONLY` flags and expose the matching `F_GETFL` mode. Lookup and key
iteration require read access; update, delete, and freeze require write access;
lookup-and-delete requires both. Batch commands apply the same matrix. A denied
operation returns `EPERM` after fd/type resolution and before touching key or
value pointers. The mode belongs to the file description, not `BpfMap`: pinning,
info, program load, and `BPF_PROG_BIND_MAP` still address the object itself, and
reopening a pin creates a fresh descriptor with the requested mode.

`BPF_MAP_FREEZE` is object-wide and one-way for the four keyed kinds. A
successful call prevents every later syscall update/delete, including the
batch and lookup-and-delete forms, with `EPERM`; lookup and iteration remain
available, and program-side kfunc updates remain legal. A repeated freeze or a
freeze racing an already admitted syscall writer returns `EBUSY`. The runtime
linearises these through `BpfMap::begin_sys_write` / `SysWrite`, so freeze
cannot return while an earlier userspace write can still commit. Ring buffers
return `EOPNOTSUPP`: their writable consumer-page `mmap` is not yet represented
in that writer accounting, so reporting success would leave a userspace alias
that can still mutate the ring.

`BPF_PROG_BIND_MAP` adds an object-wide, post-load lifetime reference from a
program to a map. It never extends the verifier-visible or executable map set:
only maps resolved from the instruction image at load time may be addressed by
`LD_IMM64`. Rebinding the same object through any fd is an idempotent success;
distinct bindings are retained until the program dies and are reported after
the load-time maps in `bpf_prog_info.map_ids`. The mutable lifetime-only set is
lock-protected separately from the immutable runtime lookup table, so binding
cannot race program execution into seeing an unverified map.

`BPF_PROG_LOAD` accepts Linux's `fd_array` / `fd_array_cnt` contract. A
non-zero count eagerly validates and binds every map or BTF fd; maps appear
once in `bpf_prog_info.map_ids`, while type-erased strong references keep BTF
objects alive without making the Rust-derived verifier depend on BTF. The
64-distinct-map and 64-distinct-BTF limits match Linux. Count zero preserves
the legacy lazy form used by `BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_IDX`: each instruction resolves
its signed index directly from userspace's array. Sparse indices are recorded
explicitly beside the immutable image, not inferred from the used-map vector,
so duplicate maps, BTF entries, and unused slots cannot renumber a reference.
The verifier, interpreter, and JIT consume that same index table; none rewrites
the submitted instructions. A missing array is `EPROTO`, an unreadable entry
is `EFAULT`, an unopened fd is `EBADF`, and a live non-map/non-BTF fd is
`EINVAL`.

### 3.5 Object pinning

`BPF_OBJ_PIN` stores a strong reference to a map, program, or link in bpffs;
`BPF_OBJ_GET` creates a fresh close-on-exec fd for that same object. Pinning
therefore extends object lifetime without preserving the creating descriptor's
map access mode. `BPF_F_PATH_FD` gives both commands `openat(2)` pathname
semantics through the existing VFS `resolve_at_path` contract: relative paths
are anchored beneath a live directory fd, absolute paths ignore it, and a
relative path reports `EBADF` or `ENOTDIR` before bpffs lookup. A nonzero
`path_fd` without the flag is `EINVAL`. Resolution is subsequently passed
through the ordinary cwd/chroot normalization, so path-fd pinning cannot escape
the task's filesystem view.

### 3.6 Runtime statistics

`BPF_ENABLE_STATS(BPF_STATS_RUN_TIME)` returns a close-on-exec anonymous fd and
globally enables Linux-visible `bpf_prog_info.run_cnt` / `run_time_ns` while at
least one independently-created stats file description remains live. `dup`
shares a file description and therefore one enable reference; another enable
call owns another reference. Entry samples the global gate once, so a run that
started enabled is fully counted even if the last fd closes before it returns,
and a run already in flight when the first fd opens is not counted
retroactively. Time is measured with `narf_time::monotonic_ns` around the
actual interpreter, JIT, or sleepable-program execution.

The runtime's always-on `runs` / return-value / trap counters remain separate:
kernel attach logic and diagnostics use them even when userspace has not paid
the timestamp cost. Only the gated counters are exposed through
`bpf_prog_info`, matching Linux rather than leaking the internal bookkeeping.

### 3.7 Program instruction introspection

`BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD` exposes both instruction images through Linux's
`bpf_prog_info` in/out fields. `xlated_prog_insns` is the exact immutable
Linux-ISA image accepted at load: NARF records map-fd and map-index resolution
beside the image and never patches its immediates. `jited_prog_insns` is the
sealed native text when the verifier and architecture JIT admitted the program;
an interpreted program reports length zero. The caller supplies capacities in
`xlated_prog_len` / `jited_prog_len`; each buffer receives at most that prefix,
while both returned lengths report the complete images. Zero capacity performs
a sizing query without touching its pointer, and a non-zero copy to an invalid
pointer returns `EFAULT`. The syscall-wide privileged BPF credential gate also
guards native dumps, which can contain resolved kernel addresses.

### 3.8 Program tags

Every successfully loaded `BpfProg` records Linux's stable eight-byte program
tag and exposes it through `BpfProg::tag()` and `bpf_prog_info.tag`. The tag is
the first eight bytes of SHA-256 over the submitted Linux instruction slots.
Before hashing, both immediate halves of `BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_FD` and
`BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_VALUE` loads are zeroed: descriptor numbers are process-local
allocation results and cannot define program identity. Map-index pseudo loads
remain unchanged because their indices are stable inputs from the load-time fd
array. Hashing is streamed through `narf_crypto::sha256::Sha256`; it does not
mutate or duplicate the immutable instruction image retained for execution and
introspection.

### 3.9 Program license metadata

Linux-shaped loads copy `bpf_attr.license` with the kernel's 127-byte bound;
a null or invalid pointer is `EFAULT`, while a non-terminated 127-byte prefix
is accepted and classified as non-GPL. `BpfProg::load_with_license` records the
classification and `BpfProg::gpl_compatible()` exposes it to
`bpf_prog_info.gpl_compatible`. Classification is an exact byte-string match
against Linux's set: `GPL`, `GPL v2`, `GPL and additional rights`,
`Dual BSD/GPL`, `Dual MIT/GPL`, and `Dual MPL/GPL`. Case changes, trailing
spaces, `GPL v3`, and other licenses remain valid loads but report false.

NARF's typed kfunc registry has no GPL-only category, so the bit is load
metadata rather than a second helper allowlist. If a future kfunc gains such a
policy, it must consume this stored classification during verification rather
than re-reading mutable userspace memory.

### 3.10 Program provenance metadata

Every successful load records its completion time in monotonic nanoseconds
since boot. A Linux-shaped `BPF_PROG_LOAD` additionally snapshots the loader's
effective uid in `LoadMetadata`; later credential changes cannot rewrite the
program's provenance. `BpfProg::load_time_ns()` and
`BpfProg::created_by_uid()` expose the immutable values through
`bpf_prog_info.load_time` and `created_by_uid`. Direct in-kernel loaders have
no userspace credential and therefore use uid 0.

### 3.11 Program verifier log

`BPF_PROG_LOAD` accepts Linux's coupled `log_level`, `log_size`, and `log_buf`
fields, including all four public log bits. When requested, NARF writes one
NUL-terminated verdict record: successful loads report the accepted instruction
count, and verifier failures report `LoadError`/`VerifyError`, retaining every
available instruction index. `log_true_size` includes the terminator and is
written whenever the caller's attribute size covers it. A truncated log is
`ENOSPC`, an invalid destination is `EFAULT`, and either log delivery error
supersedes the underlying verifier result, matching Linux finalization.

### 3.12 Named raw tracepoints

`BPF_RAW_TRACEPOINT_OPEN` copies Linux's bounded 127-byte name, resolves only
sites explicitly published by `narf_tracing::register_named_probe`, and returns
a close-on-exec owning `BpfLink`. Closing the last link fd detaches the program.
`BPF_PROG_LOAD` accepts `BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT` as an atomic program and
retains type 17 in `LoadMetadata`; `BpfProg::linux_prog_type()` keeps that
object identity separate from its verifier `Context`. The raw-open command
requires this type, while fentry, XDP, and iterator paths reject it even though
they are also atomic. `BPF_PROG_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT_WRITABLE` remains
`EOPNOTSUPP`: NARF's probe context is read-only, so accepting type 24 would
promise write-through argument semantics the runtime cannot provide.
Static marker metadata does not imply a runnable dispatch site and therefore
does not resolve by itself. The link retains the name and caller cookie for
`bpf_link_info` (`BPF_LINK_TYPE_RAW_TRACEPOINT`), including Linux's in/out name
buffer, true-length, truncation, and `EFAULT` behavior. Raw and id-selected
attaches both claim the resolved dispatch id in the single-owner table, so the
two ABIs cannot attach independently to one physical hook.

### 3.13 Program recursion misses

Every `BpfProg` owns an always-on `recursion_misses` counter. `run_atomic`
increments it exactly when the current CPU's per-CPU stack nesting budget
refuses an invocation; an oversized request or unavailable provider remains a
plain refusal and is not misclassified. `BpfProg::recursion_misses()` exposes
the cumulative value through Linux's `bpf_prog_info.recursion_misses` field.
The counter is independent of `BPF_ENABLE_STATS`, matching Linux: timing and
successful-run counts pay the opt-in timestamp cost, while recursion refusals
are counted whenever they occur.

### 3.14 Rust-native typed tracing reads

In-tree trace sites describe readable object fields with
`narf_tracing::TypedProbe`: a kernel-wide type name/key, the concrete object
size, and an exact list of `(offset, size)` fields. `BpfProg::load_for_typed_probe`
verifies an atomic program against that schema. The context's first field is an
opaque, read-only `TraceObject` pointer with provenance distinct from ordinary
kernel `Object` pointers; ordinary loads through it remain
`VerifyError::OpaqueDeref`.

Programs read a declared field through
`narf_probe_read(dst, dst_len, source, field_offset)`. Its Rust-derived kfunc
descriptor requires one verifier-bounded writable destination, one wildcard
trace object whose concrete key comes from the program schema, and one constant
offset. Verification accepts the call only when `dst_len` and `field_offset`
exactly match one declared field; being merely in bounds is insufficient. The
live tracing wrapper independently repeats the exact-field and whole-object
bounds checks before copying. The implementation is shared by the interpreter
and both native backends through their existing kfunc-call ABI.

Typed objects are borrowed only during synchronous `fire_typed` dispatch.
Accordingly typed loads require `Context::Atomic`, scalar fires and different
schemas do not invoke them, and the public raw-context `run_atomic` and
`run_atomic_interpreted` entry points decline them. Only the crate-private
typed attach adapter may construct the wrapper context. This prevents an
in-kernel caller from forging the pointer consumed by the runtime mediator.
Kfunc descriptors cannot return `TraceObject`, so they cannot manufacture that
provenance from a normal kernel-object address.
BTF remains a Linux loader/introspection compatibility surface, not the source
of NARF's kernel type authority.

### 3.15 Dynamically bounded XDP packet reads

`BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP` programs are verified for an atomic two-word hook context:
word 0 is a read-only `PtrKind::Mem` packet `data` pointer and word 1 is its
exclusive `PtrKind::MemEnd` `data_end`. Both descriptors carry the same
non-zero `TypeKey`, used here as a dynamic-region identity rather than a Rust
object type. An end pointer may be compared but never dereferenced or adjusted.

A packet pointer initially has no readable extent. On an unsigned 64-bit
comparison between a constant-offset data pointer and its same-key end, only an
edge proving `data + N <= data_end` (or the equivalent reversed comparison)
publishes an `N`-byte readable prefix. `<` publishes `N + 1`; equality publishes
`N`. The guarantee reaches live register aliases, intersects by minimum at
control-flow joins, and every load must fit wholly inside it. A different key,
a signed or 32-bit comparison, a non-constant offset, or an insufficient prefix
proves nothing. Stack-spilled aliases are deliberately not recovered yet; that
rejects some safe programs rather than guessing provenance.

Live classification and `BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN` supply frame addresses only through
`BpfProg::run_xdp`; the generic raw-context execution methods refuse XDP
programs. Test-run copies Linux `data_in` into a kernel-owned frame, refuses
caller `ctx_in`/`ctx_out`, CPU selection and batch mode, normalises zero repeat
to one, and caps one synchronous call at a 64 KiB frame and 1024 iterations.
Because XDP frames are currently immutable, `data_out` is the copied input;
short output receives its prefix and the actual size with `ENOSPC`.

The interpreter independently bounds each packet load against the exact
borrowed slice. The JIT emits a direct read only for a verifier-published
`bare_access_site`, so the program's dominating comparison is the native
runtime guard. Frames remain immutable: stores are rejected by the context
descriptor, and `XDP_TX`/`XDP_REDIRECT` remain unsupported.

### 3.16 Native arena atomics

The x86_64 and aarch64 JITs lower naturally aligned word and doubleword arena
atomics after computing the same `slot_base + zero_extend(handle + off16)`
address as ordinary arena accesses. Add, non-fetching bitwise operations,
exchange, compare-and-exchange, load-acquire, and store-release are native, as
are the fetching bitwise operations. x86_64 has no single-instruction atomic
fetch-and/or/xor, so those become a `cmpxchg` retry loop that preserves R0 in a
reserved frame word (the arena fault ABI already claims `rcx` and `r11`, and the
loop must not move `rsp`); the comparand load is the sole faulting access, after
which the recovery handle in `rcx` is free to serve as the loop's scratch.
aarch64 uses its LSE fetch forms directly, landing the old value in a scratch
that is not the recovery handle so a fault still names the offending index.

Before the atomic memory instruction, emitted code tests the effective address
for natural alignment. Failure returns JIT status `ARENA_UNALIGNED` with the
offending handle and becomes `Trap::ArenaUnaligned`; it cannot partially execute
the operation. A mapped but inaccessible address instead follows the registered
arena exception-table entry and returns `ARENA_FAULT`. Both outcomes stop the
program, and unsupported lowering fails closed to the interpreter.

## 4. Invariants

Numbered for `safety-argument.toml` references. **This subsystem touches
`frame/`, `memory/`, and `capabilities/`, so it is a TCB change** under
AGENTS.md: two maintainers (one security), signed commit, `security-review`,
and a `safety-argument.toml` entry.

**4.1 — BPF kernel-VA top-level tables are allocated at boot, before the first
user address space.** `new_user_pml4_on` snapshot-copies PML4[256..511] by
value with no later propagation, so a slot first populated after a user AS
exists leaves that AS's CR3 holding a zero entry, and any BPF access while
that task is current **triple-faults**. `reserve_kernel_slots()` is a direct
call from `bare_main.rs` after MMU init, *not* a staged initcall. A
`debug_assert` in `new_user_pml4_on` checks both slots are present so a future
reordering fails loudly.

**4.2 — JIT text is mapped RX at its own VA, with no writable and no
executable alias.** Per assumption 2.4 every kernel window is NX apart from
kernel text and the AP trampoline, so the bytes are executable at exactly one
address; and `seal` makes every kernel window that aliases the pack's frames
read-only, so they are writable at none. An attacker with an arbitrary kernel
write can neither turn heap, stack or buddy memory into code nor overwrite live
JIT text.

Consequence for the code: the RW→RX publish can no longer write *through the
alias*, so a `text_poke_copy` equivalent exists — `text_poke::poke_copy`, a
transient per-CPU RW+NX window over one frame at a time. §8.6's item 1 and
item 2 landed together for exactly that reason.

The one range where this is weaker: an aarch64 **fallback** pack (scattered
4 KiB frames, built only when the hugepage pool is empty) keeps its writable
alias, because making it read-only would mean a break-before-make on a live
block descriptor in the kernel's own linear map. §8.6 states the trade and what
closing it would cost.

**4.3 — Extable registration precedes execution.** Every faulting instruction
the JIT emits has an `ExEntry` registered *before* `seal()` publishes the text
as executable. A fault with no entry is fatal, by design.

**4.4 — Sleep safety, lock discipline, and reference tracking are one rule.**
At an await point, every live register whose `ValidityDomain` fails
`survives_await()` is killed. No separate lock-held check, no
`bpf_rcu_read_lock` equivalent.

**4.5 — Sleepability is declared by the hook, not by the program.** A program
verified for `Context::Atomic` cannot attach to a sleepable hook or vice
versa; the mismatch is a type error at attach, not a runtime flag check.

**4.6 — A running program may not allocate.** Permitted: `try_alloc_atomic`
(handling `None`), `atomic_pool`. Forbidden: the global allocator,
`alloc_frame`, any `IrqSafeSpinLock` a caller might hold, and all of
`narf_tracing::dispatch::*` (§4.7). Map values live in slabs pre-sized at
creation, so `map_update_elem` never allocates.

**4.7 — BPF programs must not re-enter the probe dispatcher.**
`tracing::dispatch::fire()` invokes handlers *while holding* `TABLE.inner`
with IRQs masked. Any BPF-reachable path back into `dispatch::*` self-
deadlocks. The kfunc set is a closed, audited list, and the `dispatch.rs`
Stage-4 rework (drop the lock before invoking) is a **prerequisite** of the
fentry attach type, not a follow-up.

**4.8 — Atomic and sleepable programs use different stacks.** Atomic programs
draw frames from the per-CPU BPF stack region; sleepable programs get a heap
stack owned by the future, because a sleeping program cannot hold a per-CPU
slot across a yield. Atomic execution holds a `!Send`, preemption-disabled
domain guard for the whole non-sleeping run. Sleepable execution re-enters
`DomainId::BPF` for every
poll and drops the guard before returning `Pending`, so suspension always hands
neutral rights back to the scheduler and migration is safe.

**4.9 — Fuel bounds total work and is never refilled.** `narf_yield()` lets a
sleepable program cooperate; it does not restore fuel. Exhaustion terminates
the program with a diagnostic, not a fault.

**4.10 — Loading requires `Cap<BpfProgLoad, Grant>`.** There is no
unprivileged mode and no second set of limits.

**4.11 — The verifier fails closed.** Any construct it cannot prove safe is
rejected. `VerifyError` carries an instruction index wherever one exists.

**4.12 — Typed tracing reads are mediated twice.** Load-time verification must
relate an exact constant `(offset, width)` to the program's Rust-native object
schema, and the synchronous live wrapper must repeat both the exact-field and
whole-object bounds checks before copying. Typed programs cannot execute from
a caller-supplied raw context, and direct `Object` loads stay opaque.

**4.13 — Dynamic packet reads need both relational proof and a live runtime
region.** A same-key `data`/`data_end` comparison may certify only the prefix
its constant offset proves, and no other pointer comparison changes memory
access rights. `run_xdp` is the sole constructor of the real-address context;
its callers may supply only a Rust slice, and raw execution cannot forge the
context. The interpreter checks the borrowed slice again, while native code is
admitted only at a verifier-certified access site. The borrow ends synchronously
before the RX caller may recycle the DMA buffer or the test-run syscall returns.

## 5. Architecture notes

### x86_64

- **VA layout.** BPF text and arena windows each take a dedicated PML4 slot,
  clear of the identity map (0), high MMIO (1), the per-domain PCID slots
  (256..=271), vmalloc (272 — note `vmalloc.rs:15`'s "273" comment is wrong),
  the direct map, and the kernel image (511).
- **Prog pack.** One 2 MiB hugepage per pack from `memory/src/hugepage.rs`
  (`alloc_hugepage_2m_on`), mapped by a single PMD entry so ~500 programs cost
  **one iTLB entry** instead of one each — the entire rationale, stated
  verbatim at `kernel/bpf/core.c:863`. Hugepages do not fall back to the buddy
  (`hugepage.rs:17`), so a 4 KiB fallback path is required rather than failing
  the load.
- **Seal.** Rewrite leaf PTEs to drop `WRITABLE`, drop `NO_EXEC`, add `GLOBAL`;
  then one ranged `invlpg_global_range`, not 512 IPIs; then a serialising
  instruction. `GLOBAL` is correct: BPF text is identical under every CR3.
- **Extable hook.** `frame/src/x86_64/trap.rs`, inserted after every legitimate
  recovery surface (demand paging, stack grow, COW) and *before*
  `probe::consume` and `diag::note_pf`, so a recovered BPF fault neither steals
  another recovery nor poisons the first-fault-wins panic latch. Kernel-mode
  only. The fixup zeroes the destination GPR by mutating the trap frame, so the
  JIT needs one fixup label per program rather than a stub per site.
- **Arena addressing.** One register pinned to the window base; accesses are
  `[base + reg + off16]`. Guard regions are whole unmapped slots, so escape by
  immediate displacement is structurally impossible — the same derivation as
  Linux's `GUARD_SZ` (`arena.c:45`), with room to spare.

### aarch64

- **There is no kernel fault recovery today.** No `arch/src/aarch64/probe.rs`
  exists, and `frame/src/aarch64/trap.rs` handles only data aborts from a
  *lower* EL; `EC = 0b100101` (current EL) falls through to `exit_kernel(42)`.
  The extable is first-of-its-kind here, not a re-wiring.
- **Cache maintenance — fixed.** `arch::patch_word` used to do `dsb ish; ic
  ivau; dsb ish; isb` with **no `dc cvau`**, which the architecture requires
  before `ic ivau` unless `CTR_EL0.IDC == 1`. It now delegates to
  `narf_arch::aarch64::asm::flush_icache_range`, which reads `CTR_EL0` for the
  line size and elides `dc cvau` / `ic ivau` on `IDC` / `DIC` exactly as
  Linux's `__flush_cache_user_range` does. `bpf_text::seal` uses the same
  primitive, scoped to the sealed allocation rather than the whole pack.
- **TLB.** `tlbi vale1is` is inner-shareable and self-broadcasts, so no IPI
  plumbing is needed — an asymmetry with x86_64 worth remembering.
- The JIT is x86_64-first; aarch64 runs interpreted until its emitter lands.

## 6. Dependencies

`narf-bpf-isa` → nothing. `narf-bpf-verifier` → `isa`. `narf-bpf-jit` → `isa`,
`verifier`. `narf-bpf` → those plus `narf-lib`, `narf-arch`, `narf-memory`,
`narf-capabilities`, `narf-crypto`, `narf-rcu`, `narf-filesystem`, `narf-tracing`,
`narf-init`. `narf-userspace` → `narf-bpf` (never the reverse).

Capabilities: `Jit` (0x0053), `BpfProgLoad`/`BpfAttach`/`BpfMap`/`BpfArena`/
`BpfStructOps` (0x0300..). struct_ops reuses the existing pluggable-policy
caps — `SchedPolicy` (0x0203), `IoScheduler` (0x0206), `CongestionControl`
(0x0207), `IdleGovernor` (0x0208) — so it needs no new cap plumbing.

## 7. Stage assignment

Stage 5+. Depends on the MMU, buddy/slab, capabilities, RCU, tracing dispatch,
and the perf event layer, all of which are closed.

## 8. Open questions

1. **Arena pointer width and truncation sequence.** A 32-bit in-program pointer
   costs one `mov eax,eax`; a wider one costs a shift pair but lifts the 4 GiB
   cap. Whether to keep a 32-bit fast path for small arenas is a Phase-3 call.
2. ~~**Demand-populated arenas need a new `FileOps` hook.**~~ — **resolved.**
   `FileOps::mmap_fault(offset) -> Result<u64, FsError>` is a defaulted trait
   method returning the frame for one page, answered from the demand-paging arm
   of the page-fault handler instead of once at `mmap` time. A userspace
   `MAP_SHARED` mapping of an arena now **tracks** the arena rather than
   snapshotting it: a page populated after the `mmap` appears on first touch.
   `Arena::snapshot_frames` and `ArenaError::SnapshotTaken`, the interim typed
   error that made the resulting hole loud, are deleted — there is no hole left
   for them to name.

   Routing, since it crosses three crates. `RegionPerms::FILE_DEMAND` marks a
   region whose unbacked slots come from a file rather than from the frame
   allocator; `AddressSpace::demand_alloc_page` resolves such a fault through
   `install_file_fault_hook`, **with the regions lock dropped** (the hook
   re-enters the filesystem, which allocates, takes its own locks, and for an
   arena installs a kernel page-table entry), then publishes the frame into the
   region's `phys` slot and falls through to the existing "backed but no leaf"
   branch so the leaf install and its spurious-fault reasoning exist once.
   `narf-memory` still holds no filesystem types: the hook is a `fn` pointer,
   the same seam shape as `install_shared_frame_hooks` and `install_pager`, and
   `userspace/src/mapped_file.rs` — which already knew which file a user address
   belongs to — supplies it. `sys_mmap` installs it on the path that creates the
   first `FILE_DEMAND` region, so unlike §4.1's page-table slots there is no
   boot-order constraint. `mmap_frames` stays for files that are genuinely a
   snapshot (`/dev/fb0`, perf's ring, `linux_compat`); `sys_mmap` tries it
   first and falls to `mmap_fault`, probing by asking for the first page, which
   is idempotent and about to be touched anyway.

   **What is still not demand-populated: the program itself.** §4.6 forbids a
   running program from allocating, and populating a page allocates a frame and
   walks page tables — so a program cannot fault one in, and the interpreter's
   arena access is a plain kernel dereference with no extable entry behind it,
   which makes an unbacked page a kernel fault rather than something
   recoverable. `ProgArena` therefore has a **live** extent (the populated
   prefix, one atomic that only grows, which is what keeps `resolve`
   allocation- and lock-free) and a **reserved** extent it may grow into.
   Everything off the run path may grow it — `bpf(2)`, creation, and the
   demand-fault path. Giving programs their own growth needs either a kfunc
   over a pre-charged frame reserve with pre-populated page tables, or Linux's
   answer (`bpf_arena_alloc_pages` over `kmalloc_nolock`, `arena.c:857`); both
   are §4.6 amendments, not follow-ups to this item.
3. **Nested locks.** v1 permits one live `Guard` at a time. Nesting under a
   declared lock-order lattice is deferred.
4. **`struct_ops!` form.** Whether it re-declares traits or mirrors existing
   ones via `struct_ops_for!(path::Trait { … })`.
5. **Continuation-style JIT lowering for sleepable programs**, replacing "
   sleepable ⇒ interpreted".
6. **Making JIT text unwritable, not merely un-aliased-executable.** The first
   half of this is **done**: `mmu::init_mmu` and `frame/src/aarch64/boot.S`
   build every kernel window NX/`PXN|UXN` except `[__kernel_start,
   __text_end)` and the AP-trampoline window, demoting 1 GiB → 2 MiB → 4 KiB
   at boot so those exceptions are stated at the granularity they need. The
   demotion is built *before* the CR3/`sctlr_el1` handoff, so it never splits
   a live mapping. `memory/src/tests.rs` pins the result: a buddy frame has
   no identity alias, or only a non-executable one, and on x86_64, once SMP
   bring-up has finished, every 4 KiB page of the AP-trampoline window is
   unmapped, or mapped read-only and non-executable. No test checks that the
   window is executable while APs boot. The higher-half
   kernel window gives a buddy frame no alias at all: it maps only the kernel
   image rounded out to 2 MiB leaves, `frame/src/bare_main.rs` keeps that
   whole range out of the frame allocator, and
   `memory/src/kernel_window_audit.rs` walks the live window and proves that
   none of the frames it maps is owned by or free in the allocator.

   The *writable* half is now **done for hugepage-backed packs on both
   arches**, which is every pack the allocator builds unless the boot-time
   hugepage reservation came up empty. `memory/src/text_poke.rs` carries both
   halves, and they landed together because neither is useful alone — (1)
   without (2) breaks program loading, and (2) without (1) is a mechanism
   guarding nothing.

   1. **`seal` makes the pack's alias read-only.** `text_poke::protect_ro`
      walks every kernel window that aliases the pack's frames — the low
      identity map, the higher-half kernel window (the image rounded out to
      2 MiB, which no allocator frame should reach), and the
      direct map when a >512 GiB machine has one — and clears `WRITABLE` /
      sets `AP_RO_EL1` on each. Where a live huge leaf is in the way on
      x86_64 it is split, following `__split_large_page`
      (`arch/x86/mm/pat/set_memory.c:1121`): the replacement table is filled
      with translations *identical* to the leaf it replaces, so Intel's TLB
      application note — which makes behaviour undefined only when the large
      and small translations **differ** — does not bite, and the swap is one
      naturally-aligned 8-byte store. The attribute change happens only after
      a **synchronous** global flush (`flush_user_tlb_all_cpus`, which spins
      for every peer's ack via `shoot_full`), exactly Linux's
      split → `flush_tlb_all()` → change ordering. `bpf_text`'s `PACKS` lock
      plays the part of `cpa_lock`.

      x86_64 additionally needed **`CR0.WP`**, which NARF's boot path never
      set — measured `CR0` was `0x80000011`. Without it a supervisor store
      ignores the R/W bit (Intel SDM Vol 3 §4.6.1) and a read-only alias is
      decoration. `text_poke::enable_write_protect` sets it on the BSP
      (`bare_main`, right after the MMU handoff) and on every AP
      (`_ap_start_rust`), because `WP` is per-CPU state.

   2. **A `text_poke_copy` equivalent.** `text_poke::poke_copy` maps **one
      4 KiB frame at a time** RW+NX at a **per-CPU** scratch VA above the pack
      region in the BPF text slot, copies, and unmaps before returning. Per-CPU
      rather than global so only its owner can ever form a translation for it,
      which is what makes a local `INVLPG` sufficient — the same reason Linux's
      `text_poke` uses a per-CPU fixmap slot. `write` and the freed-program
      trap fill both route through it once the pack's alias is protected.
      `reclaim` calls `protect_rw` before releasing the frames, or the next
      owner of the frame would inherit a read-only alias.

   **What remains open: aarch64 fallback packs — which in the default
   configuration is *every* aarch64 pack.** State it that way rather than as a
   corner case, because the hugepage pool is populated only by `hugepages_2m=N`
   on the cmdline (`bare_main.rs`), and neither the test runner nor a default
   boot passes it. So `alloc_hugepage_2m_on` fails, `new_pack` takes the
   `PACK_SMALL_BYTES` arm, and every pack is 16 scattered 4 KiB frames.

   On x86_64 that is fine — those frames *are* protected, via one extra
   2 MiB → 4 KiB demotion, which is the same mechanism as the 1 GiB → 2 MiB one
   and carries no additional architectural risk. On aarch64 it is not: NARF's
   linear map is built by `boot.S` at 2 MiB block granularity, so protecting one
   4 KiB frame would mean splitting a live block, and ARMv8 requires
   break-before-make when a translation's block size changes. A BBM on the
   linear map would unmap live kernel memory on every other CPU for the
   duration — far worse than the gap. Linux arm64 declines the identical split
   for the identical reason: it does not split the linear map, it boots it
   page-mapped up front when it knows it will need to change permissions
   (`rodata_full` / `can_set_direct_map()`). `text_poke::can_protect` therefore
   refuses sub-block ranges on aarch64, `seal` leaves `Pack::alias_ro` false,
   and the pack keeps its writable alias rather than the kernel taking a TLB
   conflict abort.

   Net effect today: **on aarch64 the pack-level protection engages only for
   hugepage-backed packs, i.e. only when the kernel is booted with
   `hugepages_2m=N`.** The mechanism itself is verified on aarch64 regardless —
   `smoke_text_poke_protect_round_trip` protects and restores a 2 MiB-aligned
   buddy block directly — but the `bpf_text` smokes skip there, and they say so
   rather than passing.

   Two ways to close it, in increasing order of cost. The cheap one is to make
   the fallback pack a **2 MiB-aligned, 2 MiB contiguous buddy block**
   (`frame::alloc_pages_on(node, 9)` / `free_pages`, a new `Backing` variant
   mapped with `map_2mb`) instead of 16 scattered 4 KiB frames: every pack then
   lands on exactly one block descriptor, aarch64 needs no split at all, and
   x86_64 stops needing the 2 MiB → 4 KiB level too. The thorough one is to
   build the aarch64 kernel RAM window at 4 KiB granularity at boot — the trade
   Linux makes — which is a change to `boot.S`, not to this module.

   Pinned by `memory/src/bpf_text.rs`
   (`smoke_bpf_text_sealed_alias_is_unwritable`,
   `smoke_bpf_text_sealed_alias_write_faults`,
   `smoke_bpf_text_second_alloc_in_sealed_pack_runs`,
   `smoke_bpf_text_reclaim_restores_writable_alias`) and
   `memory/src/text_poke.rs` (`smoke_text_poke_write_protect_is_on`,
   `smoke_text_poke_window_is_transient`). The first pair is the load-bearing
   one: the write that worked before this change is performed through the
   linear alias and required to `#PF` with the present+write error bits set,
   with the byte proved unchanged afterwards.
7. ~~**Fuel accounting granularity**~~ — **resolved: per instruction.** Per
   back-edge bounds iterations rather than work: 65536 straight-line
   instructions cost one unit, so the default tank permitted ~7e10
   instructions per invocation, which is no bound inside an atomic probe. The
   interpreter burns per instruction retired; the JIT will burn per basic
   block, the same bound at coarser granularity.

   The cost of that choice is now **measured**, not asserted. `cargo xtask
   bpf-bench` runs the interpreter over four instruction mixes under both
   policies as an A/B pair, N = 60 each, samples interleaved round-robin, and
   applies §8's protocol. Median cycles per interpreted instruction, and the
   per-instruction policy's cost relative to the hoisted one:

   | shape  | cycles/insn | delta | 95% CI | decision |
   |--------|------------:|------:|--------|----------|
   | alu    | 97.4 | +0.22% | [+0.07, +0.37] | inconclusive (tests disagree) |
   | mem    | 122.7 | +0.40% | [+0.26, +0.62] | significant, within δ |
   | branch | 89.6 | +0.63% | [+0.43, +0.79] | significant, within δ |
   | call   | 88.1 | +0.03% | [−0.11, +0.25] | no difference established |

   Declared δ is 3%. The suite also carries an **A/A control** — a second
   monomorphisation of the production policy, compared against production —
   whose delta bounds what the harness can resolve: within ±0.2% on this
   runner. The controls are what make the numbers above readable, and they
   corrected an earlier answer: a two-arm build measured +2.4% on `mem` and
   +1.2% on `branch`, and adding a third instantiation moved both to under
   0.7%. Most of that 2.4% was where the function landed in the image, not
   what it did. Between-build code placement is a larger effect on this
   interpreter than the fuel policy is.

   So the original justification — "the interpreter already pays a decode and
   a match per instruction, so the marginal cost is noise" — holds, with the
   number attached: at most ~0.7% of interpreter throughput, on the
   branch-heavy mix, well inside δ. Item 7 stays resolved.

   Runner caveat: collected under KVM on an AMD Zen4 laptop whose §8.2
   noise-control preconditions (governor, boost, SMT, ASLR) are **not** met.
   `bpf-bench` refuses such a runner unless `--allow-unverified-runner` is
   passed. That mode prints advisory diagnostics but emits no JSON performance
   record. These are development measurements, not publishable perf numbers;
   the conclusion survives because the effect is an order of magnitude below
   δ, not because the environment was clean.
8. **aarch64 `probe.rs`.** Porting the x86_64 recoverable-probe module would
   let `memory/src/tests.rs`'s four `probe::arm` sites stop being x86-only.
   Optional scope, but adjacent.
9. **An ABI for kfuncs that await.** The kfunc calling convention is one
   uniform `extern "C" fn(u64, u64, u64, u64, u64) -> u64`, which is what lets
   the interpreter transmute a shim address once and the JIT emit one call
   sequence — but a `u64` is not a future, so a sleepable kfunc cannot go
   through it. `narf_yield()` is currently an interpreter intrinsic recognised
   by id (`interp::Vm::call_kfunc`). A second sleepable kfunc, or any kfunc
   that parks on real I/O rather than yielding to itself, needs a real answer:
   either a second shim shape returning `Poll`, or a registry flag routing
   sleepable kfuncs through a boxed-future path. Related: `interp::drive`
   spins because `YieldNow` wakes itself, which is only sound while `yield` is
   the sole await point.
10. **A `Guard` cannot be both linear and sleep-unsafe under the Phase-0
    contract.** `ArgDesc::consumes_in_arg_position` requires
    `domain.requires_release()`, which only `ValidityDomain::Owned` satisfies —
    but `KfuncDesc::validate` rejects a `PtrKind::LockGuard` return whose
    domain survives an await, and `Owned` does. §1.11's three properties want
    both. The fix is probably for linearity to key on `PtrKind::LockGuard`
    directly rather than on the validity domain; it should land with the
    abstract interpreter, which is the first consumer that cares.
11. **`bpf(2)` load latency has no yield point, and verification dominates
    it.** Measured by `cargo xtask bpf-bench` (N = 60, same runner caveat as
    item 7), for one `BpfProg::load` of a 64-instruction straight-line
    program:

    | phase | median cycles | share |
    |-------|--------------:|------:|
    | verify | 140 050 | 69% |
    | codegen | 11 076 | 5% |
    | publish (text alloc + write + extable + seal) | 47 322 | 23% |
    | **total, end to end** | **203 878** | |

    The three parts sum to 198 448 against a measured 203 878 — a 2.7%
    residual for `BpfProg::load`'s own bookkeeping, which is also the check
    that the decomposition is real.

    The concern is the scaling. Verification costs 3 030 cycles per
    instruction at 16 slots, 2 188 at 64, and 1 978 at 256 — flat, because it
    is amortising a fixed cost, not because the fixpoint is cheap. Forking
    changes that: the 194-slot `branchy194` shape (64 forward forks) costs
    5 121 cycles per instruction, 2.6× the straight-line rate at comparable
    size. `MAX_INSNS` is 65 536, so a maximally-branchy program at that rate
    is on the order of 3 × 10⁸ cycles — ~100 ms — spent inside `sys_bpf` with
    no yield point and no fuel-equivalent bound on the *verifier's* own work.
    Fuel bounds what a program does at runtime; nothing bounds what proving it
    costs.

    Two things this suggests, neither scoped yet: a work budget on the
    fixpoint that fails a program as too complex rather than making the caller
    wait, and an await point in the load path so a long verification is
    preemptible. Note that Linux's `BPF_COMPLEXITY_LIMIT_INSNS` is exactly the
    first of those, and §4.9's argument for not having one was about
    *termination*, which fuel does handle — it was never an argument about
    latency.

    **Severity, and why nothing is being changed yet.** This is a quality-of-
    service characteristic, not a denial of service: `bpf(2)` requires euid 0
    (§4.10, `task_may_load_bpf`), so the only caller who can provoke a 100 ms
    stall is one who can already do considerably worse. It is a privileged
    process making its own syscall slow.

    The existing `fixpoint_round_budget` does not bound this and is not the
    lever. The measured 5 121 cycles per instruction is the cost of a fixpoint
    that *converges* — real work proportional to branching, not a divergence —
    so a tighter round cap would reject legitimate programs without addressing
    the cost of legitimate ones.

    So: recorded with numbers, deliberately unfixed. Adding a complexity limit
    now would trade a real capability (large branchy programs verify) against a
    problem no caller has reported, and the design already carries one
    cautionary example of defensive machinery guarding a case that could not
    arise (§9, the sizing fixpoint). The lever if this ever bites is an await
    point in the load path, which costs nothing when verification is fast.

    **The worklist membership cost is fixed without adding a complexity
    limit.** A generated dispatch CFG can leave thousands of distinct taken
    arms pending while the LIFO verifier follows the fallthrough chain. The
    worklist previously used `Vec::contains` before each enqueue, making that
    valid shape quadratic even though every block itself converged once. The
    verifier now retains the same LIFO order and state transitions but tracks
    queued membership in a block-indexed bitmap. A permanent 2,048-arm / 6,147
    instruction benchmark pins the shape. In an N=100 development comparison,
    its median fell from 27,694,008 to 26,483,616 cycles: -4.37%, 95% bootstrap
    CI [-4.48%, -4.29%], with Welch and Mann-Whitney both significant after
    Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The ordinary `branchy194` case moved +0.28%,
    inside its 3% delta. As with item 7, the laptop failed the §8.2 governor,
    boost, SMT, ASLR, thermal-telemetry, and idle-host gates, so these are
    explicitly advisory development measurements, not publishable numbers.

    **Amendment — the reasoning above did not cover every shape, and one of
    them was a genuine divergence.** The paragraph beginning "The existing
    `fixpoint_round_budget` does not bound this" rested on the measured cost
    being "the cost of a fixpoint that *converges*". A review found a class
    where it does not converge: a loop *nested* inside another cycle had no
    widening point at all, because Tarjan returns maximal SCCs (so the inner
    header has no predecessor outside the component) and an irreducible inner
    loop has no dominance back-edge either. Measured: 16 385 rounds / 6 ms at 13
    slots, rising linearly to 8 195 073 rounds / 3.3 s at 16 013 slots — roughly
    13 s at `MAX_INSNS`, and `fixpoint_round_budget` was the *only* thing
    stopping it, at 30–130× the honest cost. It also rejected safe programs with
    `FixpointDiverged`, which this document describes as a verifier bug.

    Fixed in `ir.rs` pass 7b by iterating the widening set to a fixed point —
    the essential content of Bourdoncle's hierarchical decomposition without
    materialising the weak topological order — so that **every cycle contains a
    widening point**. That invariant now has a test
    (`every_cycle_has_a_widening_point`) rather than resting on inspection.

    The QoS-not-DoS conclusion still stands for the *converging* case, which is
    what the original numbers measured. The lesson worth keeping is narrower: a
    latency measurement taken over programs that converge says nothing about
    programs that do not, and "the budget is not the lever" was true of the cost
    and false of the bound.

12. ~~**A packet pointer needs *dynamic* region bounds, and the obvious
    shortcut is an information leak.**~~ — **resolved with paired data/end
    provenance and a runtime slice bound.** XDP programs formerly received the
    frame summarised into the context tuple (length, then 24 bytes as three
    words) because a program could not dereference the frame at all.

    `PtrClass::Mem` is already the right class — "an untyped bounded byte
    region", which is exactly what a packet is. What blocks it is that
    `PtrVal::size` is an `Option<u64>`: a *constant*. A packet's length is only
    known at runtime, so the feature is `Mem` whose bound comes from a register
    or a sibling context field rather than from a literal. That is the same
    feature a variable-size map value needs, and the same one a kfunc returning
    `&[u8]` needs — the descriptor cannot express a size in return position
    today for the same reason.

    **The shortcut to avoid:** declaring the region a fixed size (an MTU, say)
    and letting programs read anywhere inside it. That is unsound here in a way
    it would not be for a buffer we owned. The frame reaches the classifier as
    an *immutable borrow of a driver DMA buffer* — see the XDP attach notes —
    so the runtime cannot zero the tail, and a program reading past a short
    frame's real length would see the previous packet's bytes. An
    information leak, and exactly the fail-open shape §9 records two of.

    The implemented answer is dynamic bounds, not the shortcut. Context supplies
    real `data` and `data_end` pointers carrying one region key. The verifier
    recognises only a same-key unsigned 64-bit comparison, records the proved
    prefix on the safe edge, and publishes a bare-access certificate only after
    the complete load width fits. The interpreter independently resolves the
    address inside the live frame slice; XDP raw-context execution is refused,
    so a caller cannot forge the two kernel addresses. The classifier borrow is
    synchronous and read-only. Tests pin the positive guard, missing and short
    guards, mismatched provenance, an undereferenceable end marker, short live
    frames, packet-content-dependent verdicts, and the syscall load/attach path.

13. ~~**A userspace `mmap` of an arena keeps nothing alive, so arena frames are
    leaked rather than freed once exposed.**~~ — **resolved: the mapping owns
    the reference, and the leak branch is deleted.**

    The defect. `Arena::drop` frees each frame; a userspace `MAP_SHARED` mapping
    of those frames kept nothing alive; so `mmap` the arena, close the fd, let
    the program exit, and the last `Arc<ProgArena>` drop returned live
    user-mapped frames to the buddy — a userspace-writable window onto arbitrary
    recycled kernel memory. Arenas were the first `mmap_frames` user where it
    mattered, which is why the contract had never been stressed: `/dev/fb0`
    hands out device memory that is never in the buddy, and perf's ring lives as
    long as the task. Neither reason generalises.

    The interim answer was to leak: `Arena::drop` kept the frames out of the
    allocator whenever `inner.snapshotted` was set, counted by
    `leaked_exposed_arenas()`. That branch, its counter, and its test are gone.

    **The fix.** `userspace/src/mapped_file.rs`'s owner table — Linux's
    VMA-held file reference, kept outside the memory TCB so regions stay free of
    filesystem types — holds an `Arc<dyn FileOps>` per mapping, registered by
    `sys_mmap` and released by `sys_munmap` and by process exit. For an arena
    that `Arc` is an `ArenaFile`, which owns the `Arc<ProgArena>`, which owns the
    `Arena`. So a live mapping makes `Arena::drop` unreachable, and reaching it
    means no mapping remains. The table was already there for writeback; what
    changed is that it is now load-bearing for *memory safety*, said so in its
    own module docs, and `sys_munmap` releases it strictly after the unmap
    (releasing first would reopen the same window).

    Demand paging made this structural rather than incidental: `mmap_fault`
    reaches the file *through* that same table, so a mapping that did not hold
    the reference could not be faulted at all.

    **Pinned in both directions**, through the frame allocator rather than a
    flag, because a flag-reading test would pass even if `drop` ignored it:
    `sys_mmap.rs`'s `smoke_bpf_arena_mapping_keeps_frames_alive_until_munmap`
    drops every kernel-side handle under a live mapping and measures the
    free-frame count across that drop, then measures it again across the
    `munmap`; `memory/src/bpf_arena.rs`'s
    `smoke_bpf_arena_drop_returns_frames_to_the_buddy` covers the memory-layer
    half, which cannot see a mapping. An implementation that never frees passes
    one and fails the other, and vice versa.

14. **Resolved — BPF has a first-class hardware domain.** `DomainId::BPF = 14`
    is entered for atomic execution and around every poll of sleepable
    execution. On PKS, the dedicated per-CPU stack pages are tagged to that
    domain. x86_64 PCID performs the corresponding BPF-root CR3 switch. Aarch64
    preserves the full SCTLR/GCR task context but remains structurally confined
    until allocation tags are deployed. Maps and sleepable heap stacks remain
    FRAME allocations, so the present guarantee is escape containment from
    other private subsystem domains, not isolation from FRAME itself. Full
    design and residual ownership work are in `domain-confinement.md`.

## 9. Post-review corrections

A Fable review of the merged subsystem returned **do not land** with three
kernel-compromise or kernel-hang defects, two of them reachable unprivileged.
All fourteen findings are recorded here because several were *documentation*
that had come loose from the code, and the pattern is worth keeping.

Closed: unbounded arithmetic on faulting pointer classes (arbitrary kernel
read/write); a non-terminating fixpoint (stack slots joined, never widened —
an unprivileged kernel hang); `bpf(2)` gated on a capability the syscall
minted for itself; a 32-bit null test discharging a reference; unbounded arena
byte regions; a wrapping ctx access panicking the kernel; a per-CPU frame
released on the wrong CPU; BPF-to-BPF frames ignoring the verifier's table;
`seal` not enforcing §4.3; the runtime never depending on the memory
subsystem at all; a boot-order guard compiled out of release builds;
`CAP_JIT` gating the inverse of the JIT flip; a cross-crate frame-zeroing
obligation stated nowhere; fuel bounding iterations rather than work.

**The dominant failure mode was not any individual bug.** Four separate
safety arguments lived in one crate while depending on another's behaviour,
and stayed correct-looking after the thing they rested on changed:

* `PerCpuFrames: Sync` rested on handlers running with IRQs masked for their
  whole duration — a premise *this same series* removed when `dispatch::fire`
  was reworked to drop its lock before invoking.
* §4.3's extable-before-execute was prose; `seal` never checked.
* The verifier's caller-frame precision loss was safe only because the runtime
  zeroes frames, with nothing on either side saying so.
* `Ok` from the verifier carried obligations (`fault_sites`, `subprogs`,
  `uses_arena`) that nothing consumed.

Accordingly: an invariant that spans two crates belongs in a test, not in a
comment on one side of the seam.
