# AGENTS.md — NARF Navigation Map

Token-efficient orientation for AI agents (and humans in a hurry).
Everything here is terse by design. Follow links for depth.

## Project in 3 lines

- **NARF** = Rust *framekernel*: minimal Ring-0 TCB + 16 hardware
  domains (PKS on x86_64, MTE on aarch64).
- **Async-first** executor, zero-copy Narf-Ring IPC, capability-typed
  access control, no root user.
- **Status:** Stages 1–4 closed. Stage 4 exit gate met for the
  in-tree shell + coreutils (`cargo xtask run-interactive` types
  `echo hello world` over serial; full IRQ-4 → byte ring → fd 0 →
  shell → fd 1 → UART chain). `cargo xtask test` runs 5022+ smokes
  / 0 fail / 73 skip on x86_64 + aarch64. Stage 5 "Silicon" — boot
  on AMD Zen2 Renoir + Phoenix HawkPoint1 laptops — is in progress.

## TCB definition (matters for review bar)

`frame/` + `memory/` domain manager + `capabilities/` core + executor
core in `scheduler/` + `security-model/`. Touching any = TCB change =
two maintainers + `security-review` pass mandatory.

## Load-bearing invariants (cheat sheet)

These are the rules that, if violated, make the design unsound.
Each links to its owning spec for the full text.

| # | Rule | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PKRS / TCF lives in **task-context** `DomainSavedState`; scheduler saves on preempt + restores before any access in resumed task's domain. Direct context transfer restores before callee's first instruction. | `memory/` §4, `scheduler/` §4, `frame/` §4 |
| 2 | `enter_domain`/`exit_domain` paired; nested same-domain entry is an assertion. Trap prologue saves PKRS to trap frame and switches to `DomainId::FRAME` before any Rust runs. | `frame/` §3–§4 |
| 3 | `DomainPrimitive::BACKEND = Pks \| Mte` is a **type-level** contract — code that needs O(1) rights flip must `#[cfg]` to `Pks` or accept the MTE pointer-tagging cost. | `arch/` §3–§4 |
| 4 | All domain / TLB / cache / MSR intrinsics are wrapped with `compiler_fence(SeqCst)` before AND after the `asm!`. Fat LTO can otherwise reorder loads/stores across a `WRMSR`. | `build/` §4, `arch/` §4 |
| 5 | **Holding `Cap<T, R>` proves *prior grant*; only `Cap::invoke()` proves *current validity*.** Epoch revocation is O(1); never dereference around `invoke`. | `capabilities/` §3–§4 |
| 6 | `CapSlot` is **128 bits** (generation + index + rights + type_tag), updated via CMPXCHG16B / LDXP-STXP. | `capabilities/` §3 |
| 7 | Dropping a submission Future **requests** cancellation (`OpCode::Cancel`); resources release only on terminal completion (`Ok` \| `Cancelled` \| `CancelRequested` \| `Error`). | `abi/` §3.1 |
| 8 | Narf-Ring: **explicit release/acquire pair** on every index transition (`STLR`/`LDAR` on aarch64); cache-line partitioned head/tail/payload; pointer **retag** on cross-domain aarch64 writes; `Result<T, RecvError>` on `recv`; SQ-full **blocks via waker**, CQ-full sets **overflow flag**. | `ipc/` §4, `abi/` §4 |
| 9 | `console::remap_to_virtual(VirtAddr)` is part of the MMU bring-up critical section — without it the console silently dies the moment paging turns on. | `console/` §3.1, `memory/` §6, `boot/` §4 |
| 10 | `DomainId` namespace is **owned by `security-model/` §4.1** (FRAME=0, CAPS=1, MEMORY_MGR=2, SCHED=3, IPC=4, TRACER=5, KEYS=6, OBSERVE=7, USERSPACE_K=8, DRIVER(0..5)=9..14, SCRATCH=15). `memory/` §3 mirrors as `DomainId::*` constants. |
| 11 | QSBR readers may **not `await`** inside a critical section — only sleepable-RCU may. `ReadGuard` is `!Send` to enforce. Sleepable-RCU is **cap-gated** with budget + timeout-bounded sync. | `rcu/` §3.3, §3.5 |
| 12 | `SeqLock<T: Copy>` bound is load-bearing (torn-state sampling is UB without `Copy`). `SpinLockGuard<'_, T, IrqState>` typestate makes mixed-IRQ-context use a compile error. | `lib/` §3 |
| 13 | AI-originated TCB PRs include `safety-argument.toml` referencing `security-model/` invariants by `section#Lline`; CI rejects unresolvable refs. Audit trail is SLSA in-toto + `narf-agent` predicate. | `process/` §6.3, §6.5 |

## Sync → async bridge primitives (`narf_scheduler`)

Drivers and sync subsystems should **never hand-roll spin loops on
hardware registers**. Use the right primitive from `narf_scheduler`:

| Primitive | When to use | Lock-safe? | CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spawn(fut)` | Normal async work in executor context | yes | scheduler-managed |
| `yield_now().await` | Cooperative yield from inside an async task | yes | yields |
| `block_on(fut)` | Sync caller bridging to async path; **no IrqSafeSpinLock held** | **no** (halts on IRQ) | idles between IRQs |
| `block_on_spin(fut)` | Same as above but caller holds an `IrqSafeSpinLock`, is in an IRQ handler, or runs in a panic / SMP-startup path with IRQs disabled | yes | 100% spin |
| `sleep_pumps::run()` | Inside any waiting loop (or as a periodic tick) — drives FB drain, cursor pump, future audio drain | yes | trivial |

**Constraints both `block_on` variants share:**
- **Never call from inside an executor poll** — re-entrant deadlock; the
  executor's polling loop blocks waiting for a future that needs the
  same loop to make progress. No runtime check; caller's responsibility.
- **The awaited future must be IRQ-driven or self-waking.** A future
  that depends on another scheduler task to make progress will hang
  because `block_on` doesn't run the executor.

**Cooperative `block_on` lock rule (load-bearing):** holding any
`IrqSafeSpinLock` across `block_on` deadlocks. The lock disables IRQs
while held and `halt_until_irq` waits for one. Migration patterns
should drop the lock, capture any owned data (clone an `Arc`, copy a
phys address), then `block_on(...)`. Use `block_on_spin` if you can't.

**Same rule applies inside the awaited future.** Async driver
functions that `block_on` is supposed to bridge to must not hold an
`IrqSafeSpinLock` guard (for example a `&mut Controller`) for their
*entire* duration — if they do, the IRQ wake they're waiting for can
never fire. (NVMe's former `submit_io_irq_async` did exactly this and
was removed unused.) The migration is
**not** "wrap existing sync code in block_on"; it's:

1. Convert per-driver lock from `IrqSafeSpinLock` to a regular
   `Mutex` (safe to hold across await), OR
2. Restructure the async path to release the lock before the
   `.await` point and re-acquire after.

Until that lands, `block_on(driver_async_fn(...))` will deadlock on
real HW. `block_on_spin` is fine because it doesn't disable IRQs.

`block_on` and `block_on_spin` both **panic on call from inside an
executor poll** (`CURRENT_TASK != 0`) — caught at the call site
instead of becoming a silent re-entrant deadlock.

**Compile-time enforcement: `IrqSafeSpinLockGuard` is `!Send`.** Any
`async fn` that holds an `IrqSafeSpinLock` guard across `.await`
becomes itself `!Send`, breaking the `Send` bound in
`narf_scheduler::spawn`. Build error instead of a runtime hang.
Use a block scope (`{ let g = lock.lock(); ... }; foo().await`) to
shrink the guard's lifetime explicitly — `drop(g)` does **not**
shrink an async future's captured-state lifetime the way it does
in sync code.

### Sync-wrapper decision tree

A sync wrapper (`BlockDeviceSync::read`, future `FsOps` sync paths,
etc.) needs `block_on` ONLY when its underlying driver path
**waits on an IRQ**. If the driver polls a hardware register
(MMIO read of a "done" bit) without IRQ involvement, the existing
hold-lock-across-busy-spin pattern is correct — no IRQ wake means
no deadlock risk under IrqSafeSpinLock.

| Sync wrapper | Underlying path | Migration? |
|---|---|---|
| `NvmeBlockSync::read/write` | `read_lba`/`write_lba` polled CQE | no |
| `AhciBlockSync::read/write` | polled DD bit | no |
| `VirtioBlkBlockSync::read/write` | polled used-ring | no |

If a future driver needs IRQ-driven sync I/O (e.g. NVMe over
MSI-X for latency-sensitive workloads), the migration is:
1. Convert the per-driver `IrqSafeSpinLock<Option<Controller>>`
   to `narf_lib::mutex::Mutex<Option<Controller>>` (async-safe).
2. Have the async path take `&self` + internally lock the Mutex.
3. Sync wrapper calls `block_on(driver.read_async(...))`.

**Why this exists:** the audit (commit `de5dabc`) found drivers
re-implementing 10M-iteration spin loops on MMIO registers in
NVMe / AHCI / e1000 / r8169 / ixgbe. Each spin froze the cursor /
FB / serial console for the wait duration. The unified primitives
let drivers hand the wait off to a single mechanism that ticks
sleep_pumps + idles cleanly.

**Per-driver migration is bespoke.** Drivers expose async functions;
their sync wrappers
(`BlockDeviceSync::read`/`write`) call `block_on(...)` after dropping
their per-driver locks. Don't sweep `spin_tick` everywhere — the
abstraction lives in `block_on`, not in every driver.

## Stage::Late spawn rule (load-bearing)

`narf_scheduler::init()` panics on a second call (since commit `3f4eadd`
— `__reset_queues_for_test` is the test-only equivalent). The historic
"second `init()` in `run_async_demo` silently wipes Stage::Late spawns"
bug killed the cursor pump and USB HID supervisor for weeks before
diagnosis; the panic now surfaces double-init at the call site.

Drivers can spawn from Stage::Late initcalls again; the spawn survives.

## Merge gates (all must be green)

1. Build (x86_64 + aarch64, release + debug).
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
3. `cargo fmt --check`.
4. Unit tests.
5. Functional tests (QEMU on both arches).
6. Spec consistency: §3 updated if interface changed.
7. Perf gate (if `perf-sensitive`-tagged) — statistical protocol in
   `verification/…/spec.md` §8.
8. Review bar per change class.

## Performance numbers — never claim without the protocol

From `verification/…/spec.md` §8:

- N ≥ 30 samples (100 if CV > 5%). Dedicated core, freq pinned, SMT
  off, no turbo, ASLR off.
- Report **median + 95% bootstrap CI** (10k resamples) + p95/p99/p99.9.
  Never mean alone. Never a single sample.
- Regression detection: Welch's t-test **and** Mann-Whitney U (both
  must agree). Apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (q = 0.05) across the suite.
- Blocking only if significant **and** beyond declared δ.

## Debugging methodology — kernel crashes, esp. SMP heisenbugs

Hard-won on the weston SMP selector-corruption crash. Apply when a
fault is intermittent, SMP-dependent, or vanishes when you instrument it.

**Heisenbug rule — instrument the FATAL path, never the hot path.**
A bug whose timing window any per-trap overhead shifts closed is a
heisenbug. A `Drop` guard / validator at the top of `rust_trap_handler`
*will* mask it (confirmed: weston went 0/8 with a trap-frame validator).
Diagnostics that run *only* in the fatal-exception printer (after the
crash, never per-trap) are zero-perturbation — put GS base, CR3, wide
raw stack dumps, struct dumps there freely. A few atomic stores per
trap are tolerable (a 4-store per-syscall record did NOT mask); branchy
logic / locks / serial I/O per trap are not.

**Flight recorder** (`frame/x86_64/trap.rs::trace_rec`, when present):
per-CPU lock-free ring, one `rdtscp` per record (yields TSC *and* cpu id
from `IA32_TSC_AUX` in ~30 cyc), recorded at the single trap chokepoint,
dumped per-CPU newest-first by the fatal handler. Per-CPU rings (not one
shared) — a contended global counter cache-line-bounces every trap and
perturbs. Record `frame as *const _` (the kernel-stack addr the trap
landed on) to spot two CPUs' frames overlapping one stack.

**Reading a crash frame:**
- Values with `(v & 3) == 3` are **segment selectors** (RPL=3). A
  selector in a code/rip slot ⟹ a seg-register save landed in the wrong
  place (signal McContext, iretq frame, or a saved trap frame).
- A fault `rsp` at a *constant offset below a stack-size-aligned top*
  (e.g. always `top − 0xB60`) ⟹ a specific code path at a fixed call
  depth, NOT random corruption. Compute it.
- At a kernel-mode (cs=0x08) fault, `IA32_GS_BASE` must be this CPU's
  PerCpu (BSP = a high-half static; APs = a low-heap leaked Box). A
  user-looking / zero base ⟹ swapgs imbalance.
- Symbolize saved return addresses on the stack + `rbp`/`r14` against
  `nm -n` to recover the call context the registers point into.

**Localize before fixing.** Rule theories OUT against the code, not by
assumption (concurrent-poll, sigreturn, TSS-race, RCU were all disproven
this way). The SMP repro is the oracle: deterministic regressions fail
the *same* test every run; flaky/heisenbug fails *vary* run-to-run.

## Navigation & Tooling (For Agents)

- **Use `semcode-mcp`** (`find_type`, `find_function`, `find_callers`) for precise, AST-aware lookups of Rust structs, enums, and call chains. It perfectly boundaries docstrings and definitions. *(Note: Requires `semcode` from `git@github.com:hodgesds/semcode.git` on branch `feature/rust-analyzer-integration` as it is not merged upstream yet).*
- **Use terminal tools** (`awk`, `grep` via `run_command`) when extracting massive lists, counting occurrences, or filtering large blocks of code (like the 2,000-line `Syscall` enum) to avoid blowing out your token context window.
- **Use `grep_search`** for broad keyword discovery across the repo when you don't know the exact symbol name.

## Quick commands (once `build/` lands)

```
cargo xtask run   --arch=x86_64
cargo xtask test  --arch=aarch64
cargo xtask image --arch=x86_64 --bootloader=limine
```

(Not available in design phase; documented here so the first
implementer points them here.)

## When in doubt

1. Check this file.
2. Check the target subsystem's `specification/spec.md`.
3. Check `process/…/spec.md` for process questions.
4. Ask a human maintainer.

Do not invent interfaces without updating the spec. Do not claim perf
numbers without the statistical protocol. Do not merge your own PRs.
