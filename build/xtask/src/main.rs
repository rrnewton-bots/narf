/// Build a module crate into the single relocatable object the loader wants.
///
/// A module crate is `crate-type = ["staticlib"]`, which produces an
/// **archive** — not a loadable object. Two things have to happen to it:
///
///  1. Take only the crate's own members. The archive also contains every
///     `core` and `compiler_builtins` object the linker might have wanted;
///     pulling those in would produce a multi-megabyte module out of a
///     hundred bytes of driver.
///  2. `ld -r` them together. Besides combining the members, this **merges
///     same-named sections** — which matters more than it sounds, because
///     rustc emits one `.modinfo` section per `#[link_section]` static
///     (seven for the reference module) and Linux's module build relies on
///     exactly this merge. The loader tolerates the un-merged form too, but
///     a `.ko` should be the merged one.
///
/// A module that calls into `core` beyond what the compiler inlines will
/// come out with undefined references that neither the kernel's KSYMTAB nor
/// this object can satisfy, and will fail to load naming the symbol. Linking
/// the needed `core` members in as well is the next step for that case;
/// nothing in-tree needs it yet.
/// Pick a linker that can do `-r` on either target's objects.
///
/// The host `ld` is built for one architecture and refuses a foreign object
/// with "file in wrong format", so an aarch64 module cannot be linked with it
/// on an x86_64 host. LLD is architecture-neutral — it infers the target from
/// the inputs — and `rust-lld` ships with the pinned toolchain's `llvm-tools`
/// component, so preferring it means no cross-binutils to install. `ld.lld`
/// from a system LLVM is an equally good fallback; plain `ld` is last, and
/// works only for a native-arch module.
