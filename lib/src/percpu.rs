//! Per-CPU storage wrapper.
//!
//! `PerCpu<T>` is a fixed-size `[T; MAX_CPUS]` cache-aligned to avoid
//! false sharing between adjacent CPUs' state. Access through
//! `this_cpu()` indexes by the active CPU's `CpuId` as reported by
//! `narf_arch::current_cpu_id()`.
//!
//! Stage 2 invariant: `current_cpu_id()` always returns `0` (single-
//! CPU BSP-only). The storage structure is still `[T; MAX_CPUS]` so
//! Stage-3 AP bring-up works without re-plumbing every call site.
//!
//! Layout note: each cell is padded up to 64 bytes so writes from
//! different CPUs don't false-share. `T` must be `Copy` (so the array
//! can be const-initialised); interior mutability lives in `T` (e.g.
//! `AtomicU64`).
//!
//! Hybrid-CPU registry: a flat `[AtomicU8; MAX_CPUS]` recording each
//! CPU's `CpuType` (P-core, E-core, Unknown). Populated by the BSP /
//! AP bring-up paths from CPUID leaf 0x1A on Intel Alder Lake+ silicon.
//! Read-only after SMP bring-up completes — the scheduler will
//! eventually consult it for affinity-hinted dispatch, but this pass
//! only exposes the data.

//
// Intel Alder Lake / Raptor Lake / Meteor Lake (12th gen+) ship with
// heterogeneous cores: P-cores (Core, "Golden Cove" / "Redwood Cove"
// class) and E-cores (Atom, "Gracemont" / "Crestmont" class). CPUID
// leaf 0x1A reports per-logical-CPU `core_type` in EAX[31:24]:
//
//   0x20 = Atom    (E-core, throughput-optimised)
//   0x40 = Core    (P-core, latency-optimised)
//
// Linux reads this in `arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel.c::intel_get_cpu_type`
// (callable as `get_this_hybrid_cpu_type()` from cpufreq / sched
// code) and stores it as a per-CPU `cpu_type` field. The scheduler
// then biases latency-sensitive tasks toward P-cores.
//
// NARF mirrors that storage model here. Each CPU writes its own slot
// during its bring-up path (BSP in `bare_main`, APs in
// `frame::x86_64::smp::_ap_start_rust`). The boot-log summary line
// reads the populated slots to print `cpu-topology: BSP=Core, 12
// P-cores + 4 E-cores`. AMD silicon (including the Renoir 4700U
// real-HW target) doesn't populate CPUID 0x1A at all and reports
