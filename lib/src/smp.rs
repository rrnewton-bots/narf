//! SMP discovery + online-CPU accounting (cross-arch).
//!
//! The bookkeeping half of SMP — what CPUs exist, which ones the
//! kernel has actually brought up, and the bitmap drivers /
//! scheduler / RCU consult to size their per-CPU state. Lives in
//! `narf-lib` (the broadest lower-bound dep) so every subsystem
//! can see it without crate-cycle gymnastics.
//!
//! Bring-up — the trampoline assembly + INIT-SIPI-SIPI on x86_64
//! / PSCI CPU_ON on aarch64 — is layered on top of this surface
//! and lives in `frame/`.
//!
//! APs are brought up for real, so `cpu_count()` / `online_bitmap()`
//! report the discovered topology rather than a BSP-only stub, and user
//! tasks run on application processors (`narf_scheduler::enable_user_task_smp`).
//! The cross-CPU barrier rendezvous at the end of this file exists because
//! of that: primitives that were vacuous on a uniprocessor kernel now have
//! to be real.

// ── Cross-CPU barrier rendezvous ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The "interrupt a set of CPUs and wait until each has executed a full

// `ipi_mb()` is literally `smp_mb()` (kernel/sched/membarrier.c) — the
// load-bearing property is the synchronous rendezvous, not the work the
// handler does.
//
// The protocol is arch-neutral and lives here; only "poke this CPU set"
// is per-arch, and `narf-interrupts` installs it at boot (the same
// inversion `narf_memory::tlb_shootdown::set_ipi_fanout` uses, for the
// same reason: `narf-lib` sits below the interrupt controllers).
//
// The poke is allowed to be over-broad — aarch64's GICv3 `broadcast_others`
// has no target list, and a CPU that runs the handler without a pending
// request simply finds an empty bitmap. Under-poking is what would break
// the contract, so the ack set is tracked exactly and the wait covers only
// the CPUs the caller selected.
