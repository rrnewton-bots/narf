# scheduler — Specification

> Status: **v1.0** (Stage 4 design lock). v0.3 specified PKRS/TCF
> save-restore on every preemption + direct-context-transfer
> boundary; v1.0 locks the priority class taxonomy, the
> heterogeneous-core policy, the wake-overhead cap, the
> realtime class shape, hot-plug PKS coherence, and ABI
> versioning.

## 1. Purpose & scope

**Owns:** The global async executor, per-CPU run queues, task wake-up
path, direct context transfer semantics, timer-driven preemption point,
work stealing (Stage 3+), **CPU topology model**, **affinity hints**,
**resource-account caps** (CPU share, time-slice budgets), **CPU
hot-plug** lifecycle.

**Does NOT own:** Trap entry (`frame/`), IRQ routing (`interrupts/`),
IPC (`ipc/`), memory quotas (`memory/`). The executor is driven by
those — it is the glue, not the signal source.

## 2. Assumptions

- Tasks are `Future`s pinned in kernel-allocated storage (`memory/`).
- Wakers are provided by IPC/interrupt sources.
- The Frame can disable interrupts around critical sections.

## 3. Public interface

```

Executor internals are per-CPU queues plus global stealing. The specified
design requires every task to carry `DomainId` plus architecture-neutral
`DomainSavedState`, with the executor switching domain before polling. The
current `TaskSlot` carries an opaque architecture-neutral state and switches it
at cooperative poll boundaries. Common trap entry neutralises domain rights,
while the private direct-context-transfer path saves and restores the
architecture state required by an involuntary switch. The state remains
executor-private and is intentionally absent from the policy interface.
The per-task NUMA mask is the task-identity seam for cgroup-v2
`cpuset.mems`; the page-fault policy resolver treats it as a hard
allocation boundary and removes it when the task exits or detaches. Before the
first restrictive mask is published, a monotonic acquire/release gate proves
that every lookup returns the unconstrained mask without entering a task-map
shard. The publisher raises that gate before table insertion, so a racing
reader may conservatively take the slow path but cannot miss a completed
restriction; the gate is never cleared.
The memory-controller charge provider resolves the executor-private `TaskId`
through `install_memory_pid_resolver` before charging: cgroup membership is
keyed by the outer userspace ProcessId, never by a numerically coincident task
id. Kernel tasks and unmapped bootstrap tasks remain unattributed.
An own-stack task may publish one opaque owner-defined context pointer in its
private `KernelTask`. The scheduler never dereferences it and returns it only
while that same task is current on the calling CPU. The publishing future must
retain the pointee until task destruction. This lets userspace recover its
current refcounted task state across direct resume and migration without a
process-wide identity-registry lock; cross-task lookup remains userspace-owned.
The optional userspace PMU hook brackets every stackful continuation in
executor context after run-queue locks have been released. `running=true`
precedes the switch into the task and `running=false` follows every switch
back, including preemption and migration.
The executor owns a scoped `active_mm`-style address-space handoff across
adjacent dispatches. Consecutive user tasks sharing the same
`Arc<AddressSpace>` retain the installed architecture root; different user
address spaces switch directly; a kernel task restores the executor root
before its poll. The slot moves its strong `Arc` owner into the CPU-local
active handoff before polling and moves the observed owner back afterward;
the hot switch does not clone or drop a shared reference. The installed root
remains strongly owned until after the
hardware transition. The executor also restores its incoming root before RCU
maintenance, stealing, device/sleep pumps, idle, or return. Policy callbacks
may therefore execute with the prior task's user low-half root active, as Linux
scheduler callbacks do; they must use only kernel-owned addresses. On x86_64
the kernel high half is present in every user root and SMAP blocks accidental
supervisor access to user leaves; on aarch64 the kernel remains in TTBR1. If a
poll body replaces and activates its address space (notably inline `execve`),
the post-poll publication mismatch forces an executor-root restore while both
old and replacement roots remain strongly owned; a stale outer Arc can never
authorize a same-MM switch elision. The deferred slot owner is consumed on the
next dispatch of a pending task and is retired immediately if the task instead
completes or is abnormally reaped, so a task id that never polls again cannot
retain an address space.
On x86_64 and aarch64, every own-stack switch-out folds the elapsed on-CPU slice through
the slice-account hook. A CPL0 timer preemption additionally calls `pause`
before switching and calls `resume` only when `pause` reported an open syscall
span, preventing off-CPU residency from being charged as kernel CPU time. The
callbacks run with interrupts disabled and may not sleep or take a non-IRQ-safe
lock.
Own-stack user tasks are timer-preemptible at the CPL3 scheduler tick. The
preemption path retains the task's live trap frame, FPU state, address space,
TLS base, and dedicated kernel-stack continuation across requeue, so a
syscall-free user loop cannot monopolize a CPU and strand runnable siblings.
On x86_64, switch-out saves an FP/SIMD image only after the task has consumed
the register file, then arms CR0.TS; the first user FP/SIMD instruction after
resume raises `#NM`, restores that task's image, and retries. A task is always
saved before it can migrate. Successful exec resets that task-owned image to
architectural initial state before the replacement program enters user mode.
Before every x86_64 own-stack switch-in and every direct task-to-task handoff,
the executor also applies arch's monotonic user-instruction interception
request to the executing CPU. The switch-in application is what preserves
CR4.TSD interception after migration even though the userspace future is not
polled again. The handoff application is defense in depth: a direct handoff
stays on a CPU where its source task already passed an activation point, and
no production path clears CR4.TSD. The scheduler neither owns nor dereferences
the interceptor or its process-global tool state.
A privileged consumer that must observe or replace user
FP/SIMD state (notably signal-frame construction and sigreturn) first calls
`materialize_current_user_fpu`; this restores a deferred task image, clears TS,
and marks the registers live before capture or replacement. With no published
image it still clears hardware TS and the scheduler mirror together. No
post-boot in-tree privileged consumer may execute a raw `clts`. A nested
scheduler pump saves the outer current task before polling an inner stackful
task and re-establishes the outer task's ownership before its kernel
continuation resumes. AArch64 keeps the eager FPSIMD save/restore path.
Kernel-test builds expose a hidden reset for the process-wide own-stack latch;
the userspace test-hook reset invokes it so distributed tests remain independent
of link-order. Production builds neither compile nor call this reset.
Their CPL0 syscall continuations remain run-to-completion except at explicit
park/yield points. A scheduler tick that observes a slice, budget, or
fair-quantum decision while such a continuation is running sets a sticky
task-local reschedule request; the completed syscall consumes it immediately
before returning to user mode, matching Linux's `TIF_NEED_RESCHED` shape
without suspending an unaudited lock-bearing continuation. Any intervening
voluntary switch clears the request because it already starts a fresh slice.
NARF now has a nestable CPU-local `preempt_disable()` guard,
but syscall/driver critical regions have not completed the adoption audit;
enabling arbitrary CPL0 timer preemption before that would still make an
unannotated lock-bearing continuation migratable and could strand shared state.
An own-stack task may also park from a synchronous exception continuation
(notably a demand-file page fault). The task records that the continuation was
entered through an IRQ-masking gate and always returns through the executor,
never a direct task-to-task handoff. Once the task stack is suspended the
executor unmasks IRQs so block-I/O completion can run; immediately before the
exact continuation resumes it masks IRQs again. Thus the frame's non-nested
exception contract remains intact without deadlocking the completion IRQ.
`note_urgent_wake_preempt` publishes the exact task selected by a synchronous
wake. An own-stack source may consume that publication as a bounded direct
handoff when both tasks are stackful tasks using the same execution kind, the
target is an awake default-class/normal-priority task with no period, budget
cap, or donation, and the installed source and target policies are the built-in
class or FIFO policy. A local target remains in its home queue under a
core-owned atomic claim. A remote target stays on its authoritative home and
follows ordinary dispatch through the executor's scoped `active_mm` handoff;
the direct path never moves a task or hardware address-space owner across run
queues. Dispatch and stealing skip a locally claimed target until the final
switch has completed.
When an exact synchronous wake makes a sleeping, direct-eligible partner
runnable on another CPU, the core first makes a non-blocking attempt to move
the queued wakee to the waker's CPU only when that destination has no other
runnable peer, matching Linux `wake_affine_idle(..., sync)` and its
`rq->nr_running == 1` test after accounting for NARF's off-queue running waker.
The source policy and ready-queue locks must both be immediately available,
both CPUs must use built-in direct-handoff policies, and the destination must
be online, active, and inside the wakee's live hard-affinity mask. The slot is
removed under its source queue lock and requeued through the ordinary migration
path, so policy events, virtual-runtime normalization, task ownership, and
executor restore checks remain intact. If the wakee is already running,
staged, contended, or otherwise ineligible, the running direct-eligible waker
may instead publish that partner's observed home as a one-shot co-location
hint. The waker does not migrate inside the wake path: it consumes the hint
only after its poll returns to the executor and revalidates affinity and CPU
lifecycle state before the same ordinary migration enqueue. Exact synchronous
wakes do not publish the generic idle-sibling placement hint; allowing an idle
thief to pull the just-woken endpoint would undo co-location and the local
urgent-buddy handoff. Once the pair is co-located, the existing bounded local
direct path may handle later exchanges.
The target normally returns to the source's root executor continuation. It may
instead switch directly to the root's saved task continuation when that exact
off-queue root is still runnable: either an urgent publication names the same
`WakeCell`, or no competing urgent publication exists and the root's own
runnable flag remains set from the cooperative re-arm that started the
handoff. A missing runnable flag declines; an urgent publication naming any
third task is restored to its ordinary validated path and also declines. That
same fixed root may begin another exact handoff, but the batch is capped at 64
target-to-root returns; its next yield then must reach the executor. This
amortizes executor re-entry while retaining a finite fairness and RCU-
quiescence progress bound. The off-queue root is pinned by its in-flight
executor poll, the exact root pointer plus `WakeCell` identity substitutes for
a queue lookup, and its borrow-only wake-cell pointer is published only after the
task-owned `Arc`, cleared before current-task unpublication, and remains backed
by that owner until RCU-deferred task destruction. A CPU-local whole-poll gate
refuses nested sources and arbitrary target-to-third-task chains. Before either
task's first resumed instruction,
the core publishes
its task/address-space identity and restores its hardware root, kernel-stack
target, TLS, domain byte plus architecture-saved enforcement state, FPU/SIMD
ownership, and PMU attribution. Switch-out saves the same state first. A
contended, first-run, affinity-excluded, periodic, capped, donated,
higher-class, or external-policy target declines to the ordinary
exact-buddy/full-validation path and re-kicks its authoritative home. Generic
every-wake preemption and wake-next remain opt-in. The direct path exchanges
the target's strong address-space owner into the CPU-local active slot under
its IRQ-safe lock after activation succeeds. The displaced source owner is
carried by the handoff in a non-locking per-CPU cell and moved back on return.
That cell is accessed only by its owning CPU while interrupts are masked (or by
the quiescent kernel-test reset); ownership is always moved rather than
borrowed. Thus both hardware-root transitions retain the outgoing page tables
without extra Arc clones, nested IRQ-lock operations, or an observable
ownerless interval. When the global perf gate is off, switch
attribution stops before the cross-crate callback; an enabled gate still
reaches the perf registry's authoritative live-event check.
Syscall-frequency per-CPU wake, urgent-handoff, and runnable-peer cells occupy
separate cache lines; independent CPUs never serialize their local scheduling
hints through false sharing. This is a representation rule only: the same
release publication and acquire/exchange consumption remain authoritative.
The progress counter advances when bounded synchronous waits complete, so a
long syscall with continuing I/O is not misclassified as a scheduler stall.
Forward-progress and remote-reschedule telemetry is cache-line-isolated per CPU
on update and aggregated across CPUs only for watchdog or test snapshots.
Ordinary background task polls deliberately do not advance it: scheduler churn
must not hide a foreground task that has stopped making useful progress.
The three `dbg_*` functions are bounded, read-only fatal-watchdog snapshots.
They use nonblocking queue acquisition and report current queue ownership,
awake state, affinity, and CPU idle/lock state. They deliberately maintain no
per-poll, per-pop, per-requeue, or global per-wake counters on the normal
scheduling path.

Cross-CPU wakes stage owned task slots in the target CPU's wake inbox and send
a reschedule IPI on the empty-to-nonempty edge. The IPI is notification-only;
it must not grow a ready queue or invoke a policy callback in hard-IRQ context.
The target drains the inbox under its own queue and policy locks at the next
executor round boundary. The mirrored inbox length and `NEED_RESCHED` flag
remain part of the idle-halt lost-wake handshake.

#### 3.1.1 Pluggable scheduling policy

Scheduling policy may be implemented in a separate `no_std` crate using only
the public interface below:

```rust
pub trait Scheduler: Any + Send + Sync + 'static {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn pick_next(&self, cpu: CpuId, queue: &RunQueue<'_>)
        -> Option<TaskHandle>;
    fn on_install(&self) { }
    fn on_cpu_attach(&self, cpu: CpuId) { }
    fn on_cpu_detach(&self, cpu: CpuId) { }
    fn on_task_queue_event(&self, cpu: CpuId, event: TaskQueueEvent) { }
    fn on_uninstall(&self) { }
    fn on_cpu_state_change(&self, cpu: CpuId, change: CpuStateChange) { }
}

pub struct TaskMeta {
    pub id: TaskId,
    pub work_kind: WorkKind,
    pub class: SchedClass,
    pub priority: Priority,
    pub deadline_cycles: Option<u64>,
    pub budget: ResourceBudget,
    pub account: BudgetAccount,
    pub budget_state: BudgetView,
    pub runnable: bool,
    pub affinity: Affinity,
    pub addr_space: bool,
}

pub enum WorkKind { UserThread, KernelThread, AsyncTask, SoftIrq, Idle }
pub enum SchedClass { Idle, Batch, Default, Interactive, Realtime }
pub enum TaskEnqueueReason { Admitted, Requeued, Migrated, PolicyReplacement }
pub enum TaskDequeueReason { Selected, Migrated, PolicyReplacement }
pub enum TaskQueueEvent {
    Enqueued { task: TaskMeta, reason: TaskEnqueueReason },
    Dequeued { task: TaskMeta, reason: TaskDequeueReason },
}
pub enum CpuState { Offline, Starting, Active, Idle, Draining }
pub struct CpuStateChange {
    pub previous: CpuState,
    pub current: CpuState,
    pub idle: Option<CpuIdleMeta>,
}
pub struct CpuIdleMeta {
    pub queued: usize,
    pub parked: usize,
    pub throttled: usize,
    pub borrowable: usize,
    pub next_budget_replenishment: Option<u64>,
}
```

`RunQueue` is a read-only, callback-scoped projection. It exposes queue length,
the first opaque handle, and iteration over `(TaskHandle, TaskMeta)` snapshots;
it never exposes `TaskSlot`, futures, saved domain state, stacks, queue locks,
or context-switch entry points. A policy returns only an opaque handle. The
executor validates that the handle is still queued and in the highest available
eligibility tier, then performs removal itself. `None`, a stale handle, or an
ineligible handle falls back to the first eligible core-owned slot. When no
slot is dispatchable, the core may detach one slot only for cap/affinity
maintenance and rechecks its budget before polling. A faulty policy therefore
cannot detach, duplicate, lose, run throttled work, or strand a task.

Each CPU has a local publication slot containing a generation-stamped reference
to the active policy. Dispatch takes no global policy lock and performs no
shared `Arc` reference-count write; it touches only the CPU-local policy slot
and run queue. `pick_next` executes with both local locks held and therefore
must not allocate, sleep, re-enter the scheduler, or acquire an IRQ-contended
lock.

`on_task_queue_event` is the task-control lifecycle boundary. `Enqueued` means
the copied task is now in that CPU policy's selectable set; `Dequeued` means it
has left that set for selection or migration. The callback is serialized with
`pick_next` under the same CPU-local policy/run-queue lock order, so a policy
never observes selection before enqueue. It is a bounded hot-path callback and
must not allocate, sleep, re-enter the scheduler, or acquire an IRQ-contended
lock. Runnable/wake changes remain visible in authoritative `RunQueue`
snapshots rather than invoking arbitrary policy code from a waker or IRQ.
The four exact in-tree policy types that inherit the default no-op queue-event
hook (`FifoScheduler`, `PriorityScheduler`, `ClassScheduler`, and
`EevdfScheduler`) are treated as non-observers, so the core may omit their
callback and its `TaskMeta` snapshot. Any external/wrapper policy remains
observable by default. `ClassScheduler` selection may be fused into the core's
mandatory eligibility scan, but produces the same class/priority/deadline/FIFO
ordering and remains subordinate to core budget validation. The sole pre-scan
executor selection is an exact synchronous-handoff hint for an awake task with
no periodic budget: that state proves the highest eligibility tier without
budget accounting, and wake-next already precedes class ordering within that
tier. Before returning through the executor, an eligible bounded direct transfer
may instead claim that same resident slot under its home queue lock; external
policies, periodic/capped/donated targets, and non-default task classes always
retain the full callback and validation scan. Under `ClassScheduler`, a
monotone per-CPU mask of classes
admitted or migrated there conservatively forces the full scan once a higher
class could be present; a buddy is honored only within the winning class, as
Linux applies CFS buddies only after core class selection. Stale class bits can
only disable the shortcut. The fast path leaves the runnable-peer hint
conservatively set until a later full scan, so it cannot erase a concurrent
wake.

Policy replacement is a first-class rolling operation ordered by an atomic
generation ticket. `on_install` runs once before publication;
`on_cpu_attach(cpu)` runs before that CPU can enter the new policy. Replacement
of a CPU slot waits for its in-flight callback to return, publishes the new
complete instance, then calls the old policy's `on_cpu_detach(cpu)` outside the
slot lock. `on_uninstall` runs once when the last CPU/reference releases the old
instance. A completed, non-concurrent `install_scheduler` call has processed
every CPU slot. During the bounded rolling interval, different CPUs may use old
and new policies, but one dispatch never mixes them. Task slots, runnable state,
budget/debt, affinity, and switch/domain state stay core-owned, so policy
replacement neither migrates nor reconstructs task execution state. Stateful
policies receive `Dequeued(PolicyReplacement)` on the old instance and
`Enqueued(PolicyReplacement)` on the new instance for every task queued during
the CPU-local cutover. A task already executing left the old policy at
selection; if it returns `Pending`, its later requeue enters whichever policy
is then active. This makes task-control events balanced without stopping CPUs.
Install/CPU lifecycle callbacks may allocate, but task queue callbacks may not;
none may recursively install a policy.
Concurrent installers are ordered by generation: the newest issued generation
wins every CPU slot, and an older overlapping caller returns
`SchedulerError::Superseded` if that newer ticket existed at its completion
linearization point. Superseded instances still receive balanced detach and
uninstall callbacks; callers may retry with a newly constructed policy.

`on_cpu_state_change` is an edge-triggered observation delivered after relevant
run-queue/lifecycle locks are released. `Idle` includes copied queue and budget
state; other transitions carry `idle: None`. The callback may update bounded,
nonblocking policy telemetry, but does not grant authority over hot-plug,
stealing, clockevents, architecture halt, or power state.

A separate crate is an API and build boundary, not a protection boundary. The
core remains safe against a returned stale/invalid choice, but a policy that
loops forever can deny service on the calling CPU. Policy implementations are
therefore trusted for availability and require TCB-grade review until policy
execution is moved behind a protected-domain/RPC boundary.

Budget and accounting values in `TaskMeta` are immutable copies for policy
ranking. Budget-cap liveness checks, elapsed-time charging, donation settlement,
throttling, task removal, and accounting attribution remain executor-owned.
In particular, `WorkKind` is descriptive policy input and never substitutes for
a capability, process/cgroup identity, domain id, or IRQ-source identity.
Hard IRQ/NMI execution is not a schedulable `WorkKind`; hard-IRQ entry/exit is
charged to per-CPU counters and subtracted from task dispatch time, while
deferred interrupt work uses `SoftIrq`. The same public guard exists for NMI;
architecture NMI/FIQ entry wiring remains a gate.

### 3.2 CPU topology

```rust
pub struct CpuId(u16);
pub struct NumaNodeId(u8);
pub struct CpuSet;                        // bitset; typically ≤ 4096 CPUs

pub fn cpu_count() -> u16;
pub fn cpu_topology() -> &'static Topology;
pub struct Topology {
    pub cpus: &'static [CpuInfo],
    pub numa_nodes: &'static [NumaInfo],
}
pub struct CpuInfo { pub id: CpuId, pub node: NumaNodeId, pub smt_sibling_of: Option<CpuId>,
                     pub llc_group: u16, pub freq_hint_mhz: u16 }
```

- Topology is discovered once by `arch/` at boot (CPUID leaves on
  x86_64; `MPIDR_EL1` + ACPI/DT on aarch64) and published here
  read-only.
- NUMA awareness: each `CpuInfo` records its node; `memory/`
  coordinates so per-CPU kernel storage lands on the local node.
- SMT/HyperThread sibling tracking: the scheduler avoids scheduling
  two cache-competing tasks on SMT siblings unless explicitly opted
  in (see §3.4).

### 3.3 Affinity and placement

```rust
pub struct Affinity { pub allowed: CpuSet, pub preferred: Option<CpuId> }
pub struct TaskSpec {
    pub affinity: Affinity,
    pub budget: ResourceBudget,
    pub budget_cap: Option<Cap<CpuBudget, Spend>>,
    pub work_kind: WorkKind,
    pub class: SchedClass,
    pub priority: Priority,
    pub smt: SmtSharePolicy,
}
```

- **Hints, not guarantees.** The executor honours `Affinity.preferred`
  for initial placement when possible; a completed poll remains on its
  current CPU while that CPU is allowed. Work-stealing may move a task
  within `allowed` under load. Idle balancing does not detach a victim's
  final runnable task: the currently executing task and dispatchable queued
  slots together must exceed one before a thief may take a queued slot. A task
  that was admitted or ran within the 500 us migration-cost window is
  cache-hot and is not an idle-steal candidate; explicit affinity and
  CPU-lifecycle moves are exempt.
- Process-fork placement may take a non-blocking snapshot of every allowed,
  online run queue. Its load includes dispatchable queued slots, staged wake
  inbox entries, and the currently executing task. A contended queue is
  conservatively busy. The caller's per-parent rotating preference wins a tie
  or a one-task load difference, accounting for the parent which is still
  executing the fork burst. This retains sibling distribution toward genuinely
  idle CPUs when earlier children park during setup and disappear from
  instantaneous runnable load.
  The result is only an `Affinity.preferred` hint; admission, hard affinity,
  CPU lifecycle, and dispatch-time security-state restoration remain
  authoritative.
- Runtime affinity updates are published in a task-identity registry so
  a currently-polled slot cannot miss them. A parked slot whose queue is
  excluded is moved immediately; a running cooperative continuation is
  moved only after it yields back to the executor.
- The infallible spawn API validates that an initial mask contains an online
  CPU. A partly offline mask is retained for future hot-plug; if an internal
  caller supplies a wholly stale/offline mask, creation falls back to the
  caller's online CPU instead of admitting an unrunnable slot. Subsequent
  runtime updates reject an empty effective mask.
- **`smt_share: Require`** is opt-in (latency-sensitive driver pairs
  that benefit from sharing an LLC).
- Native domain callers that restrict another domain's tasks require
  `Cap<CpuAffinity, Pin>`; the capability-bearing control surface remains
  separate from Linux process compatibility. The Linux-compat
  `sched_setaffinity(2)` bridge authorises self/same-uid processes and calls
  the task-identity/online-mask checked scheduler path.

### 3.4 Resource accounting (CPU share)

```rust
pub struct ResourceBudget {
    pub share_ppm: u32,                  // parts-per-million of a CPU
    pub burst_cycles: u64,               // contiguous-poll burst allowance
    pub deadline_cycles: Option<u64>,    // absolute monotonic-cycle deadline
    pub policy: OverrunPolicy,
    pub period: Option<PeriodBudget>,
}
pub struct PeriodBudget {
    pub runtime_cycles: u64,
    pub period_cycles: u64,
    pub max_borrow_cycles: u64,
    pub exhaustion: ExhaustionPolicy,     // Strict | IdleBorrow
}
pub struct BudgetView {
    pub eligibility: BudgetEligibility,   // Eligible | Borrowable | Throttled
    pub remaining_cycles: u64,
    pub replenish_at_cycles: Option<u64>,
    pub borrowed_cycles: u64,
    pub debt_cycles: u64,
}
pub type CpuBudgetCap = Cap<CpuBudget, Spend>;
pub fn spawn_realtime<F>(f: F, spec: TaskSpec, authority: &CpuBudgetCap)
    -> Result<TaskId, AdmissionError>;
pub fn spawn_realtime_with_options<F>(f: F, spec: TaskSpec,
    authority: &CpuBudgetCap, options: StackfulOptions)
    -> Result<TaskId, AdmissionError>;
pub fn realtime_bandwidth(cpu: CpuId) -> RealtimeBandwidth;
```

- `burst_cycles` and `OverrunPolicy` govern an individual dispatch that runs
  too long (`Throttle`, `Demote`, `Kill`, or `Ignore`). `PeriodBudget` governs
  aggregate runtime across dispatches and is authoritative when present.
- The executor initialises a period on first dispatch, deducts actual elapsed
  cycles after every poll/switch-back, and advances an expired replenishment
  boundary without looping once per missed period. Unused runtime does not
  accumulate.
- `Strict` makes an exhausted task ineligible until replenishment, even if the
  CPU would otherwise idle. `IdleBorrow` exposes a lower `Borrowable` tier:
  bounded idle capacity may run only when no `Eligible` work exists and is
  retained as debt against later replenishment.
- Cooperative/non-preemptible overshoot is also debt. It is not silently
  forgiven at the next boundary.
- Before a stackful switch-in, the core publishes soft and hard budget
  ends and arms the clockevent. At the soft end, an idle borrower resumes the
  same continuation when no competitor exists, avoiding a switch to idle and
  back. A competitor wake makes it preemptible at the next tick; the hard end
  or period boundary always switches.
- Policy receives `BudgetView` by value. It can rank eligible tasks but cannot
  replenish runtime, modify debt, or make `Throttled` work runnable. Core-side
  validation enforces `Eligible` before `Borrowable` regardless of policy.
- Budget caps are **revocable** like any cap; revocation causes the executor
  to reap the task at the next cap check.
- Realtime admission reserves the ceiling-rounded `runtime/period` utilization
  atomically against the selected CPU, the online system, and the
  `CpuBudget` capability-object domain. A conservative hash collision may
  reject admission but can never permit overcommit. Five percent of each CPU
  remains outside RT reservations for IRQ and kernel progress.
- Admitted RT tasks are pinned to their admission CPU; affinity mutation
  returns `RealtimePinned`. Generic `spawn_with_spec` and `spawn_user` demote a
  bare `Realtime` label to `Default`, so policy metadata cannot mint service.
- Driver domains typically carry a `share_ppm` large enough that they
  never hit the cap; the mechanism is there to *limit* misbehaving
  tasks, not to micro-manage well-behaved ones.
- `share_ppm` is descriptive unless a consistent `PeriodBudget` is attached;
  `runtime_cycles/period_cycles` is the enforcement source of truth.
- Stackless futures remain bounded only at cooperative poll returns. Stackful
  kernel tasks and own-stack user tasks are tick-preemptive on both
  architectures. NMI/FIQ entry accounting remains incomplete.

### 3.5 CPU hot-plug

```rust
pub fn cpu_online(id: CpuId) -> bool;
pub fn cpu_state(id: CpuId) -> CpuState;
pub fn cpu_bring_up(id: CpuId, cap: &Cap<CpuLifecycle, Invoke>)
    -> Result<(), HotPlugError>;
pub fn cpu_take_offline(id: CpuId, cap: &Cap<CpuLifecycle, Invoke>)
    -> Result<(), HotPlugError>;
```

- The implementation publishes `Draining` and waits for a target-CPU
  between-polls acknowledgement before inspecting its queue. The target's
  run loop cannot overwrite a lifecycle state with a late Active/Idle edge and
  remains logically parked while Draining/Offline. A bounded acknowledgement
  timeout or a pinned task returns `HotPlugError::Busy`; otherwise the core
  migrates the queue without holding source and destination locks together
  before publishing `Offline`.
- Architecture startup (`INIT-SIPI-SIPI` / `PSCI CPU_ON`) and physical park are
  integration gates. Logical queue drain completion is not proof firmware has
  powered the CPU down.
- Used by `power/` (when that lands) for suspend/resume and by
  stress testing in `verification/`.

Frequency control is deliberately not part of `Scheduler`. Scheduling classes
express ordering, deadlines, and latency intent; the core publishes CPU/load
observations; a separately capability-gated `power/` governor owns DVFS and
must enforce thermal and platform constraints. An external scheduler policy
therefore cannot write P-states or architecture frequency registers.

```rust
pub fn cpu_demand(cpu: CpuId) -> CpuDemand;
pub fn interrupt_account_enter(kind: InterruptKind) -> InterruptAccountGuard;
pub fn preempt_disable() -> PreemptGuard;
pub fn preempt_count() -> u32;
```

`CpuDemand` reads only one CPU-local queue and copied/atomic counters. It
reports runnable work-kind counts, RT reservation, next deadline, state, and
cumulative hard-IRQ/NMI cycles. It is a governor input, never a frequency
control callback.

## 4. Invariants & safety properties

- A task always polls inside the domain it was spawned with.
- A user task polls with its own address-space root active. On both
  architectures the executor captures the complete incoming root once, retains
  an `Arc` to every root while hardware can reference it, skips the register
  write for an exact same-MM successor, and switches directly to a different
  user MM. A kernel task or end-of-round maintenance boundary restores the
  incoming root before proceeding. Lifetime-scoped x86 PCIDs and aarch64 ASIDs
  make nonzero-tag user switches non-flushing; a tag is not reused until the
  memory subsystem completes a system-wide invalidation. A poll-time address-space
  replacement is reconciled before either root owner is dropped and forces a
  restore rather than carrying stale same-MM identity into the next dispatch.
  Its deferred slot owner is removed on completion and every abnormal reap.
- On x86_64 the executor publishes the address space's lifetime process PCID
  before loading `root|pcid|NOFLUSH`. Kernel-root restore and own-stack resume
  preserve nonzero tags. Residency is conservative history and remains set
  until tag retirement, so mapping invalidation reaches CPUs that previously
  ran even a single-threaded process. If the all-CPU PCIDE+INVPCID boot gate or
  tag allocation fails, PCID 0 retains the plain flushing behavior. A CPU
  entering either scheduler halt path marks itself TLB-idle; after wake it
  clears that state and completes any deferred full non-global flush before
  another task root or domain context can load.
  The idle/debt publication handshake guarantees a racing shootdown is handled
  either by its ordinary IPI acknowledgement or by this pre-dispatch flush.
- `donate_to` does not bypass capability checks; caller must hold a
  `Cap<Task, Invoke>` (Stage 3).
- The executor never holds a lock across a poll boundary.
- A task that parks with hardware IRQs masked cannot use direct handoff. The
  receiving executor runs with IRQs enabled, while the saved exception
  continuation resumes masked until its architecture epilogue restores the
  interrupted state.
- Work-stealing preserves per-task FIFO ordering of wakes.
- `has_other_runnable_work` may return a false positive under queue contention
  but never blocks to refine the answer. A false result means the caller can
  elide a voluntary self-yield without withholding the CPU from known work.
  The executor republishes its CPU-local runnable-peer hint after every full
  eligibility scan, while a false-to-true enqueue/wake transition sets it
  immediately; deferred wakes, due timers, and cross-CPU inbox state remain
  conservative fallbacks.
- On x86_64, a task's FP/SIMD memory image is authoritative whenever CR0.TS is
  armed. The user `#NM` path clears TS, restores only the currently published
  own-stack task image, and marks the register image live.
  Signal-frame capture performs that same materialization before reading
  hardware registers; it may not clear TS independently of the scheduler
  mirror, including when no task image is published. Every path that can switch
  or migrate that task, including a scheduler poll nested inside its syscall,
  saves a live image and re-arms TS first. The nested return restores the outer
  task's ownership before resuming its continuation. Successful exec overwrites
  the same task-owned image with architectural initial state while TS remains
  armed. A kernel-mode `#NM` is never attributed to a user task.
- A task is never scheduled on a CPU outside its `Affinity.allowed`
  set. Work-stealing and runtime requeue both respect this as a hard
  constraint; a mask change takes effect at the next cooperative poll
  boundary if the task is already executing.
- `cpu_take_offline` is atomic from a running-task's perspective:
  it sees either the old CPU or a new CPU; never a torn migration.
- Resource-budget accounting is never racy: a task that exceeds its
  budget cannot cause a refund to another task.
- A policy cannot override budget eligibility. Regular eligible work always
  outranks idle-borrow work, and strict-throttled work cannot be polled before
  replenishment.
- Idle borrowing is bounded and accounted as debt. It may save a context
  switch only while no competing eligible work exists.
- A task-scoped PMU event is active only between its matching switch-in and
  switch-out hook calls. The hook must stop and fold the current CPU's counter
  before the executor or another task runs.
- **Domain state is task context, with mechanism owned below policy.** On
  every cooperative poll return the executor calls
  `memory::save_domain_state()` before touching
  any executor-local state. On every resume it calls
  `memory::restore_domain_state(&task.domain_saved)` before the
  first instruction of the resumed task executes. No memory access in
  the new task's domain is allowed before the restore. Without this,
  every preemption is a TOCTOU window on domain rights. For stackful and
  involuntary paths, architecture-owned trap frames and `kernel_switch` close
  the same boundary without exposing register details to scheduler policy:
  entry neutralises before Rust/outgoing stores, and restore occurs after the
  last incoming-context load and before the resumed continuation.
- The synchronous-wake and `sched_yield` direct-transfer paths restore the
  callee's saved
  architecture domain state and reported domain byte before its first
  instruction, and captures both before returning to the exact root task or
  its executor continuation. A direct root return requires that root's own
  runnable flag and refuses any urgent publication naming a different task;
  it does not infer runnable state from the pinned continuation alone. Every
  exact-root return restores that root's state before its first resumed
  instruction; only that fixed root may start another transfer and the 64th
  return forces the next yield through the executor, so the batch cannot
  extend to a third task or run unbounded.
  `sched_yield` may select only the first already-runnable, same-CPU slot that
  passes the same default-class, normal-priority, affinity, budget, and policy
  eligibility predicate as a synchronous direct wake. Selection and claim use
  one authoritative run-queue lock after consuming any earlier exact-wake
  publication; an exact wake racing later remains published for the direct
  target's return boundary or the executor. Any failed check falls back to
  executor selection.
  A remotely queued target is not admitted directly to context handoff. An
  exact synchronous wake may first move that sleeping slot to the waker's run
  queue under non-blocking source-policy and source-queue locks; failure leaves
  it on its authoritative home and may ask the running waker to join that home
  through a one-shot hint consumed after poll return. Both cases check the live
  allowed mask, online topology, and CPU lifecycle before the ordinary
  `enqueue_on(..., Migrated)` path changes queue ownership. The wake path never
  transfers a running continuation, address-space owner, saved domain state,
  or FP/SIMD image across CPUs.
  `donate_to` remains a separate capability-checked budget and queue operation;
  it does not branch directly to the donee.
- **A task never polls across an await with a `ReadGuard` held
  (except sleepable-RCU guards).** The executor's `report_quiescent`
  hook relies on poll-boundary release; holding a non-sleepable guard
  across await is a UAF waiting to happen. Enforced by `!Send` + type
  discipline in `rcu/`; the scheduler treats the invariant as given.

## 5. Architecture notes

### x86_64
- Preemption point via LAPIC timer (TSC-deadline) raising a reschedule IPI.
- `mwait`/`umwait` for idle with exit latency small enough not to hurt
  wake responsiveness.
- Topology discovery: CPUID leaves `0x0B` / `0x1F` (x2APIC topology);
  LLC info from leaf `4`; NUMA from ACPI SRAT.
- Hot-plug: startup IPI (INIT-SIPI-SIPI) for bring-up; `HLT` with
  IPIs disabled for park.

### aarch64
- Preemption via the generic timer.
- `WFI` in idle, `SEV` to wake remote CPUs.
- Topology discovery: `MPIDR_EL1` + ACPI PPTT / devicetree
  `cpu-map` nodes.
- Hot-plug: PSCI `CPU_ON` / `CPU_OFF` where firmware supports it;
  otherwise fall back to parked-with-SGI wake.

## 6. Dependencies

- **Consumes:** `arch/` (timer, CPU pause, topology discovery, IPI,
  PSCI), `frame/` (enter_domain), `memory/` (task storage + NUMA-local
  per-CPU storage), `interrupts/` (timer IRQ, reschedule IPI),
  `capabilities/` (Stage 3 donation check; affinity and budget caps),
  `time/` (deadlines), `power/` (thermal/capacity feedback; never direct
  frequency-register access from scheduling policy).
- **Provides to:** every other subsystem (anything async); `power/`
  (CPU lifecycle and read-only demand/state observations for DVFS decisions);
  `rcu/` (`report_quiescent` hook at each poll boundary).

## 7. Stage assignment

Stage 1: single-CPU cooperative executor; no preemption; static topology (n=1).
Stage 2: SMP with topology discovery, timer-driven preemption point,
NUMA-aware per-CPU state, CPU hot-plug (bring up APs).
Stage 3: direct context transfer, capability-checked donation, work
stealing, affinity honoured, `ResourceBudget` accounting.
Stage 4: CPU take-offline path for suspend/resume (with `power/`),
SMT-aware placement, deadline-ish realtime class.

## 8. Resolved decisions

### 8.1 Wake-overhead cap (resolved)

**Decision:** **2 µs** (≈ 6000 cycles at 3 GHz) is the budget
for a wake-and-poll round trip in the executor. Synchronous exclusive wakes may
use the bounded direct-handoff path above; other hot paths use Narf-Ring polling
on the consumer side. `donate_to` changes budget credit and queue position and
is not itself a context transfer.

The 2 µs cap is profile-tracked; `tracing/` emits
`scheduler.wake_latency` histograms and a CI gate fails if
the p99 regresses past 2.5 µs.

### 8.2 Priority taxonomy (resolved)

**Decision:** **fixed-priority levels with budget-based
preemption**, not CFS-shaped. Five classes:

```rust
pub enum SchedClass {
    Idle,         // background; preempted by anything
    Batch,        // non-interactive bulk work
    Default,      // ordinary kernel/user tasks
    Interactive,  // boosted for low-latency response
    Realtime,     // bounded latency; see §8.4
}
```

Within a class, scheduling is per-CPU FIFO with budget caps.
Inter-class is strict priority (Realtime preempts
Interactive preempts Default …).

### 8.3 Driver-domain vs user-task fairness (resolved)

**Decision:** **per-domain budget caps**. This is the aggregation target, not
yet an implemented root-pool mechanism. Each `DomainId` will get a budget pool
(configurable at boot and manifest-overridable per driver). Tasks attribute CPU
to their domain; a spendthrift domain is throttled, not its individual tasks.

Default budgets:
- `DOMAIN_FRAME / CAPS / MEMORY_MGR` — uncapped (TCB).
- Driver domains — 100 ms / sec / CPU each (tunable).
- `DOMAIN_USERSPACE_K` — uncapped per-task; per-process caps
  set by `process/`.

### 8.4 E-core / P-core (resolved)

**Decision:** **`CpuInfo::class` enumerates {`Performance`,
`Efficient`, `Mixed`}**, populated by `bus/` from CPUID +
ACPI on x86_64 / DT `cpu-capacity` on aarch64. Tasks declare
`pref: Option<CpuClass>` in `TaskSpec`; default is `None` =
"don't care."

Scheduler policy:
- Realtime tasks → P cores when available.
- Interactive tasks → P cores preferred, E cores acceptable
  when P cores are saturated.
- Batch / Idle tasks → E cores preferred.
- Driver tasks → P core, can be relocated under thermal
  pressure (signalled by `power/`).

### 8.5 Gang scheduling (resolved)

**Decision (was open):** **no gang scheduling**. The current `donate_to`
operation transfers bounded budget credit and moves an already queued donee
to the head of its core-owned queue; it does not branch directly to the donee.
This covers the present IPC-pair priority-inheritance case without multi-CPU
coordinated dispatch. The synchronous-wake direct path is a single-CPU,
one-target transfer that returns either to the exact root once or to the root
executor, forces the next root yield through the executor, and remains subject
to the first-instruction domain-restore gate in §4; it does not coordinate a
gang.
Other producer-consumer pairs express cache locality via affinity hints.

Revisit if profiling shows specific pairs that lose >10% to
inter-CPU cache misses.

### 8.6 Realtime class shape (resolved)

**Decision:** **fixed-priority with deadline annotations and core-owned
period bandwidth**, not a claim of full Linux `SCHED_DEADLINE`. RT tasks use:

```rust
TaskSpec::realtime_periodic(runtime_cycles, period_cycles, deadline_cycles)
```

The deadline orders equal-priority realtime tasks. Runtime/period is strictly
enforced by the core. `spawn_realtime` requires a live
`Cap<CpuBudget, Spend>`, ceiling-rounds utilization, and atomically reserves it
against CPU, online-system, and capability-object-domain ceilings before the
task becomes visible. The admitted task is CPU-pinned and retains an RAII
reservation until its slot is destroyed. A label supplied through a generic
spawn path is demoted to `Default`; only successful admission establishes RT
service. This provides bounded fixed-priority periodic service, but does not
yet promise Linux `SCHED_DEADLINE`-style deadline-miss guarantees or
transactional RT migration.

### 8.7 CPU hot-plug PKS coherence (resolved)

**Decision:** **AP bring-up sequence includes a PKS-init
barrier** before the AP is marked ready. Sequence:

1. AP boot trampoline: enable PKS (`CR4.PKS=1` on x86_64;
   equivalent MTE init on aarch64).
2. Initialise per-CPU `current_domain = DomainId::FRAME`
   and write the corresponding PKRS / TCF.
3. Issue a memory fence visible to the BSP.
4. BSP polls a shared `online_count` until the AP has
   completed steps 1-3.
5. Only then is the AP accepted into the run-queue
   shuffler.

This guarantees that any task migrated to the new AP sees a
coherent domain-rights state from the first instruction.

## 9. ABI versioning

`scheduler/` exports through SDK at `@v0`:
- `spawn`, `spawn_with_spec`, `spawn_stackful_with_spec`, `spawn_user`.
- `run_until_empty`, `yield_now`.
- `Scheduler`, `RunQueue`, `TaskHandle`, `TaskMeta`, `WorkKind`, `SchedClass`,
  `TaskQueueEvent`, `TaskEnqueueReason`, `TaskDequeueReason`, `CpuState`,
  `CpuStateChange`, `CpuIdleMeta`, `cpu_state`.
- `ResourceBudget`, `PeriodBudget`, `BudgetView`, `BudgetEligibility`.
- `spawn_realtime`, `spawn_realtime_with_options`, `AdmissionError`,
  `RealtimeBandwidth`, `realtime_bandwidth`.
- `CpuDemand`, `cpu_demand`, `InterruptKind`, `interrupt_account_enter`.
- `PreemptGuard`, `preempt_disable`, `preempt_count`.
- `Cap<Task, _>`, `Cap<CpuBudget, _>`.

Task waking and IRQ integration follows
`interrupts/spec` §8 (`wait_for_irq`'s waker contract).

`SCHEDULER_ABI_MAJOR = 1`, `SCHEDULER_ABI_MINOR = 4`.

## 10. Open implementation gates

- MTE allocation-tag ownership on aarch64 (switch/vector state preservation is
  complete; enforcement is structural until the allocator is tag-aware).
- Adoption audit for arbitrary kernel-mode user-continuation preempt guards.
- NMI/FIQ entry wiring and a bounded softirq execution policy.
