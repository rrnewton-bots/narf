//! narf-scheduler — cooperative async executor.
//!
//! Spec: `scheduler/specification/spec.md`. Stage-1 subset per STAGE1.md
//! #10: single-CPU cooperative executor, intrusive-esque ready queue,
//! `spawn`, `yield_now`, `block_on`, no preemption.
//!
//! Stage 2 adds real per-task wakers (see ── Waker plumbing ──): a
//! Pending task whose waker has not fired since its last poll is
//! skipped on the next round, so futures driven by external signals
//! (IRQ handlers, IPC events) no longer cost a poll per loop iteration.
//! The halt-on-no-progress backstop is kept so self-waking futures
//! (today's `SleepUntil`, `yield_now`) still idle the CPU between
//! rounds until a hardware tick resumes us.
//!
//! Stage 3 adds CPU budgets, affinity types, and the scaffolding for
//! direct context transfer. Single-CPU reality keeps the work-stealing
//! and SMP pieces structural; what the executor *does* act on:
//! - `TaskSpec { affinity, budget, budget_cap }` on every spawn.
//! - A live `Cap<CpuBudget, Spend>`, when attached, is
//!   `check_live`-gated on every poll — revoke → task dropped next
//!   round.
//! - Per-task `BudgetAccount` accumulates measured poll cycles and
//!   ticks `overruns` when a poll blows the burst allowance.
//!
//! Stage 4 adds per-CPU run queues + opt-in work stealing. Each CPU
//! owns one slot of `READY: [_; MAX_CPUS]`; `spawn` routes by the
//! task's `affinity.preferred` (when online) or the current CPU. APs
//! enter `run_forever` after bring-up and drain their own queue;
//! `enable_work_stealing()` lets idle CPUs steal from siblings.
//! Off by default so the BSP-only test harness sees stable single-
//! CPU FIFO ordering.
//!
//! Stage 5 lands the spec's post-Stage-4 features in three waves:
//! budget-credit donation with head enqueue, domain-state save/restore at
//! cooperative yield points, and fair-share enforcement + NUMA-aware steal.
//!
//! Donation fast path (spec §3.3): `donate_to(target, &Cap<Task,
//! Invoke>)` deducts the donor's remaining burst quantum from its
//! `BudgetAccount`, credits it to the target, and head-enqueues
//! the target so the next dispatch services it first. Revoking
//! the donation cap before the donee polls refunds both sides
//! atomically at the donee's next pop (`settle_donation`).
//!
//! Architecture-neutral domain state is saved around every poll. On x86_64
//! this preserves PKRS (or the PCID fallback); on aarch64 it preserves the MTE
//! tag-check mode. The representation and switching mechanics remain private
//! to `narf_memory`, so scheduling policies cannot bypass this boundary.
//!
//! Burst-overrun handling + NUMA-aware steal (spec §3.4 / §3.2):
//! `BudgetAccount::charge` compares each completed poll with the configured
//! burst and returns a `ChargeOutcome` the executor acts on — `Throttle`
//! clears the awake flag until an external wake,
//! `Demote` reclassifies the slot as `SchedClass::Idle`, `Kill`
//! drops the slot O(1). `PeriodBudget` adds core-owned replenishment, strict
//! throttling, and bounded idle borrowing with debt repayment. `share_ppm`
//! remains descriptive unless a consistent period contract is attached.
//! `try_steal_one` prefers same-NUMA-node
//! victims (`narf_acpi::cpu_node`) before crossing nodes; design
//! follows Vyukov's CPPCON work-stealing notes
//! (https://www.1024cores.net/).
