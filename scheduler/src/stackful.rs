//! Stackful kernel tasks.
//!
//! Spec: `scheduler/specification/preemption.md`.
//!
//! Wraps a `Pin<Box<dyn Future>>` with a dedicated kernel stack
//! plus a saved `KernelContext`, so the future's `poll()` runs on
//! the task's own stack instead of the executor's. Timer traps can switch the
//! live continuation back to the executor on x86_64 and aarch64.
//!
//! With this in place, the executor can `kernel_switch` into a
//! task; the task polls its future to either `Ready` (done) or
//! `Pending` (yield); on yield, the task `kernel_switch`'es back
//! to the executor's saved context.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. `KernelTask::new(future, stack_bytes)` — allocate a stack
//!    and seed `KernelContext::fresh` with the trampoline entry
//!    + a pointer to the task itself in r15 (x86_64) or x19 (aarch64).
//! 2. Executor calls `KernelTask::poll_to_yield(&mut self, exec_ctx)`:
//!    - Records `exec_ctx` so the task knows where to switch back.
//!    - Calls `kernel_switch(exec_ctx, &task.ctx)`.
//!    - Eventually returns when the task yields or completes.
//!    - Returns `Poll::Ready` if done, `Poll::Pending` otherwise.
//! 3. Task drop: stack, future, context all drop together.
//!
//! ## Stack layout
//!
//! ```text
//!  stack_top  ─►  ┌─────────────┐
//!                 │   padding   │  (16-byte alignment for the
//!                 │             │   ABI before any function call)
//!                 ├─────────────┤
//!  initial rsp ─► │   ...       │

//!                 │   ...       │
//!                 │             │  (~16 KiB default)
//!  stack_bottom─► └─────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! Stack overflow: phase 1b uses a plain `Box<[u8]>` with no guard
//! page. Phase 3 adds a guard page via vmalloc.
