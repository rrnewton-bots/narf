//! narf-drivers-nvme — NVMe host driver.
//!
//! Spec: `drivers/nvme/specification/spec.md` + NVMe base spec rev 1.4
//! §3 (registers) and §5 (admin command set). Stage-4 cut now does the
//! whole admin-queue bring-up against a real PCIe NVMe controller:
//!   <https://nvmexpress.org/specifications/>
//!
//! - Map BAR0 via `bus::map_bar`.
//! - Decode `CAP` (queue depth, doorbell stride, MPSMIN/MAX) and `VS`
//!   (require a 1.x controller).
//! - Reset the controller (clear `CC.EN`, poll `CSTS.RDY=0`).
//! - Allocate Admin Submission Queue (ASQ) + Admin Completion Queue
//!   (ACQ) coherent DMA pages via `narf_io::alloc_coherent`.
//! - Program `AQA` / `ASQ` / `ACQ` and re-enable the controller (`CC.EN=1`,
//!   `CSS=NVM`, `IOSQES=6`, `IOCQES=4`, `MPS=0`); poll `CSTS.RDY=1`.
//! - Issue `IDENTIFY CONTROLLER` (admin opcode 0x06, `CNS=1`); poll the
//!   completion queue's phase-tag flip; ack the head doorbell.
//!
//! What still isn't here: I/O submission/completion queue pairs, real
//! NVMe-over-MSI-X interrupts (today the bring-up polls), and the
//! `BlockDevice` body's read/write/flush implementations. Those land
//! in the next pass — admin-queue bring-up unblocks all of them by
//! proving the BAR + DMA + doorbell plumbing is real.
