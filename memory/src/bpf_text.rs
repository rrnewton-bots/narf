//! `bpf_text` — the executable-text allocator for JIT-compiled BPF programs.
//!
//! Spec: `bpf/specification/spec.md` §3.3, §4.1–§4.3, §5.
//!
//! Three things live here, in decreasing order of how badly they can hurt:
//!
//! 1. [`reserve_kernel_slots`] — allocates the *top-level* page tables for the
//!    two BPF kernel-VA windows at boot, before the first user address space
//!    exists. Invariant §4.1. See the long comment on that function.
//! 2. The **prog pack**: one 2 MiB hugepage per pack, chunked at 64-byte
//!    granularity and bitmap-allocated, so hundreds of small programs share a
//!    single iTLB entry instead of burning one each. Linux states the rationale
//!    verbatim at `kernel/bpf/core.c:863`.
//! 3. The RW→RX **publish** ([`seal`]).
//!
//! ## W^X for the pack's frames
//!
//! Linux's prog pack keeps its text RO+X from creation and publishes through
//! `text_poke_copy`, because Linux's direct map is RO as well as NX and there
//! is therefore no writable alias of the pack's frames at all. NARF now has
//! both halves of that, and it is worth being exact about which piece does
//! what.
//!
//! Every kernel window `mmu::init_mmu` builds is **NX** apart from the kernel's
//! own text and the AP trampoline (see `memory/src/x86_64/mmu.rs`, and
//! `frame/src/aarch64/boot.S` for the PXN|UXN twin), so nothing outside
//! `BPF_TEXT_BASE` can execute a pack's bytes and no kernel data anywhere can
//! be executed at all. That was the first half, and on its own it left the
//! pack's frames aliased **RW**+NX: an attacker with an arbitrary kernel write
//! could no longer manufacture executable memory, but could still overwrite
//! *these* bytes, which are executable at the pack's own VA.
//!
//! [`seal`] now closes that too, via [`crate::text_poke`]:
//!
//!   1. Every kernel window aliasing the pack's frames is made **read-only**,
//!      demoting a live huge leaf where one is in the way. That is a split of
//!      a **live** mapping, unlike the boot-time demotion `init_mmu` performs,
//!      so it follows Linux's `__split_large_page` ordering — install an
//!      identically-translating table, flush every CPU synchronously, and only
//!      then change an attribute. `x86_64` additionally needs `CR0.WP`, which
//!      NARF's boot path never set; `text_poke::enable_write_protect` does.
//!   2. [`write`] into an already-sealed pack — every allocation after the
//!      first — therefore has no writable address, and goes through
//!      `text_poke::poke_copy` instead: a transient, per-CPU RW+NX alias of one
//!      4 KiB frame, torn down before the call returns.
//!
//! Neither is useful alone, which is why they landed together: (1) without (2)
//! breaks program loading and (2) without (1) guards nothing.
//!
//! **What is still open**, and why. A *fallback* pack — [`PACK_SMALL_BYTES`]
//! of scattered 4 KiB frames, built when the hugepage pool is empty — sits
//! inside 2 MiB block descriptors in the kernel's linear map. On x86_64 that
//! is protected anyway, with one extra 2 MiB → 4 KiB demotion. On aarch64 it
//! is not: making one frame read-only would mean splitting a live block, ARMv8
//! requires break-before-make for that, and a BBM on the linear map would
//! unmap live kernel memory on every other CPU. `text_poke::can_protect`
//! refuses, [`seal`] leaves `alias_ro` false, and the pack keeps its writable
//! alias rather than the kernel taking a TLB conflict abort. Linux arm64
//! declines the same split for the same reason.
//!
//! Note how wide that is in practice: the hugepage pool is filled only by
//! `hugepages_2m=N` on the cmdline, so on a default aarch64 boot **every** pack
//! is a fallback pack and the protection never engages. `bpf/specification/
//! spec.md` §8.6 records this and the cheap fix — give the fallback pack a
//! 2 MiB-aligned contiguous buddy block instead of scattered frames, so it too
//! lands on exactly one block descriptor.
//!
//! ## Reclamation
//!
//! [`free`] does **not** immediately hand chunks back: a CPU may be executing
//! the program right now. Freed allocations go to a quarantine list and are
//! released by [`reclaim`], which the owning subsystem calls after an RCU grace
//! period. `narf-memory` cannot depend on `narf-rcu` (the dep graph runs
//! `rcu → time → console → memory`, so that would be a cycle), so the grace
//! period arrives through the [`install_reclaim_hook`] seam — the same shape as
//! `install_pager` / `install_frame_alloc` elsewhere in this crate.

// ── VA layout ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both windows are picked by arithmetic, not by reading comments. A PML4 /
// L0 slot `n` spans `n << 39` bytes, so slot `n`'s canonical base is
// `0xFFFF_0000_0000_0000 | (n << 39)` for `n >= 256`, and
// `(base >> 39) & 0x1FF` recovers `n`. The `debug_assert`s in
// `reserve_kernel_slots` do exactly that check at boot.
//
// Occupied slots on x86_64 (verified against the tree, not assumed):
//   0          low identity map, 0..512 GiB       (`mmu.rs` `init_mmu`)
//   1..=255    user address space (the kernel maps nothing here)
//   256..=271  per-domain private PCID slots      (`x86_64/domain.rs`)
//   272        vmalloc, 0xFFFF_8800_0000_0000     (`vmalloc.rs` — note that
//              file's "273" comment is wrong; 0xFFFF_8800_0000_0000 >> 39
//              is 0x110 = 272)
//   384..=510  kernel direct map                  (`addr.rs`)
//   511        kernel image (-2 GiB)              (`mmu.rs`)
//
// So 273..=383 is free. We take four consecutive slots:
//
//   273  BPF text        0xFFFF_8880_0000_0000    (0x111 << 39)
//   274  guard, never mapped
//   275  BPF arena       0xFFFF_8980_0000_0000    (0x113 << 39)
//   276  guard, never mapped
//
// The guards are the ISA-derived bound from `kernel/bpf/arena.c:45`, taken to
// its structural conclusion: Linux sizes its guard at
// `round_up(1 << 16, PAGE_SIZE << 1)` = 64 KiB, because the largest
// displacement an instruction can name is the signed 16-bit `off` field. A
// whole unmapped 512 GiB slot on each side is 8388608× that, so an escape by
// immediate displacement from anywhere inside the arena window cannot reach a
// mapped page — it is impossible by construction rather than by arithmetic.
//
// On aarch64 the same numbers work unchanged: TTBR1 is configured with
// `T1SZ = 16` (`frame/src/aarch64/boot.S:150`), i.e. a 48-bit high half whose
// L0 index is also VA[47:39], and 0xFFFF_8880_0000_0000 is inside it. aarch64
// does not have the §4.1 propagation hazard at all (user space lives in TTBR0,
// the kernel in TTBR1, separate roots), but keeping one set of constants
// avoids a second mental model.
