//! Cross-CPU TLB shootdown — PCID/ASID-filtered fan-out.
//!
//! Spec: `memory/specification/asid-pcid-isolation.md` §4.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Every TLB-invalidating mapping change (munmap, RW->RO, free, copy-on-
//! write resolve, ...) must flush stale entries from every CPU that
//! *might* be caching the affected translation. A naive broadcast IPI to
//! all-but-self adds 1-5 us of cross-core latency on N-core systems even
//! when only one peer actually holds the affected mapping. The EuroSys
//! 2020 paper "Don't Shoot Down TLB Shootdowns!" (Amit, Wei, Tsafrir,
//! <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3342195.3387516>) showed that the
//! majority of broadcast IPIs are spurious -- the receiver has no TLB
//! entry for the affected tag -- and proposed filtering on a per-CPU
//! "active address space" bitmap before IPI'ing.
//!
//! This module wires that filter into NARF's fan-out path:
//!
//! * **Per-CPU active-AS bitmap (`ACTIVE_AS`)** -- each CPU advertises
//!   which PCIDs / ASIDs it currently has resident in its TLB. The
//!   scheduler publishes `set_active_as(pcid)` before it loads a task's
//!   CR3 (Intel SDM Vol 3 §4.10.4.3, "Software may assume that a TLB
//!   entry's tag matches the current PCID"). Lifetime process tags retain
//!   this conservative history across context-out; their teardown invalidates
//!   every published CPU before allocator reuse.
//! * **IPI mask construction** -- `shootdown(req)` builds the IPI target
//!   set by intersecting the online-CPU bitmap with the set of CPUs that
//!   have the affected PCID resident. CPUs that have never loaded the
//!   affected PCID are skipped.
//! * **Local-only fast path** -- if no peer CPU has the PCID resident,
//!   the call reduces to a local `INVPCID` and the IPI is skipped
//!   entirely. Single-task / per-CPU-pinned-domain workloads pay zero
//!   cross-core cost (Intel SDM Vol 2, INVPCID instruction reference).
//! * **Batched range shootdown** -- `shootdown_range(tag, va, pages)`
//!   coalesces an N-page invalidation into one IPI; the existing
//!   `narf-interrupts` bridge already loops `INVPCID(tag, va + k*4K)`
//!   on the receiver side. Saves N-1 IPI round-trips per `munmap`.
//!
//! ## Bitmap encoding
//!
//! `MAX_CPUS = 64` (see `narf_lib::percpu`). PCIDs are 12-bit per
//! Intel SDM Vol 3 §4.10.1, so a per-CPU bitmap of *which PCIDs are
//! resident* would be 4096 bits per CPU. We use a coarser hash-bucket
//! encoding: each CPU has a 64-bit bitmap, and bit `pcid & 63` is set
//! when *any* PCID hashing to that bucket has been loaded. This gives a
//! 64-way filter -- false positives are possible (two PCIDs colliding
//! on the same bucket force an IPI to a CPU that doesn't hold the
//! exact tag) but no false negatives. Today's NARF allocates <= 16
//! PCIDs (one per domain, see `arch/x86_64/pcid.rs`) so collisions are
//! expected for process PCIDs; the resulting false positives remain safe.
//!
//! ## Hard cutover (no fallback flag)
//!
//! Per project policy the broadcast path is *replaced*, not gated. The
//! one exception is **bootstrap correctness**: until a particular hash
//! bucket participates in the publication protocol, a zero bitmap cannot
//! prove that no CPU retains that tag. Each bucket therefore broadcasts
//! until its first `set_active_as`; an empty mask becomes authoritative only
//! for that tracked bucket. See `shootdown_target_mask` for the precise rule.
