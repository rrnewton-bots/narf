//! MMU bring-up and the `console/` §3.1 handoff protocol.
//!
//! Builds the kernel's final PML4 — low identity map, optional high-half
//! direct map, and the `-2 GiB` kernel window — executes
//! the handoff sequence in `console/` §3.1, and swaps CR3 to it.
//!
//! **Every leaf is `NO_EXEC` except the two ranges something demonstrably
//! fetches from.** That is what makes an RX mapping elsewhere in the address
//! space (BPF JIT text, most obviously) mean anything at all: before it, the
//! same physical bytes were writable *and* executable at their identity
//! address and again through the kernel window. The exceptions and how they
//! were derived are on [`kernel_exec_phys_range`] and
//! [`AP_TRAMPOLINE_EXEC_BASE`].
//!
//! The handoff sequence, verbatim from `console/` §3.1:
//!
//!   1. Build final page tables (including identity + kernel-virtual
//!      for the UART region).
//!   2. Call `console::write_str("mmu: handoff...\n")` via the current
//!      phys base — guaranteed visible.
//!   3. Execute MMU enable / CR3 load, then immediately call
//!      `console::remap_to_virtual(VIRT)`.
//!   4. Tear down identity mapping for the UART (kernel-virtual
//!      mapping is now sole).
//!
//! Stage 1 keeps the UART identity-mapped (no higher-half), so step
//! 4 is a no-op — the protocol still runs so future callers don't
//! have to retrofit the sequence.
