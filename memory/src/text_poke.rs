//! `text_poke` — the W^X half that the boot-time NX work does not reach.
//!
//! Spec: `bpf/specification/spec.md` §8.6.
//!
//! `mmu::init_mmu` (x86_64) and `frame/src/aarch64/boot.S` already build every
//! kernel window NX / `PXN|UXN` outside the kernel's own text and the AP
//! trampoline, so an arbitrary kernel write can no longer *manufacture*
//! executable memory. What it could still do is overwrite the bytes of a BPF
//! prog pack, because those frames stayed aliased **RW**+NX in the kernel's
//! linear window while being executable at `BPF_TEXT_BASE`.
//!
//! This module closes that, and pays the price that closing it creates:
//!
//! 1. [`protect_ro`] drops `WRITABLE` (x86_64) / sets `AP_RO_EL1` (aarch64) on
//!    every kernel window that aliases a physical range, demoting huge leaves
//!    as required. [`protect_rw`] puts it back — mandatory before the frames
//!    return to the buddy, or the next owner of the frame inherits a read-only
//!    alias.
//! 2. [`poke_copy`] / [`poke_fill`] are the `text_poke_copy` equivalent: a
//!    **transient, per-CPU** RW+NX alias of one 4 KiB frame at a scratch kernel
//!    VA, torn down before the call returns. Without it, step 1 would make
//!    every allocation after the first in a sealed pack unwritable and break
//!    program loading.
//!
//! ## Why splitting a live huge leaf is safe here
//!
//! A pack's frames can be anywhere in RAM, so [`protect_ro`] must sometimes
//! replace a **live** 1 GiB (or 2 MiB) identity leaf with a table. Unlike the
//! boot-time demotion in `init_mmu`, there is no "before the CR3 handoff"
//! escape hatch: APs are running and the BSP may be standing on the very leaf
//! being split.
//!
//! Linux does exactly this in `__split_large_page`
//! (`arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c`, today `arch/x86/mm/pat/set_memory.c:1121`) and
//! the argument is quoted in its own comment. Intel's TLB application note
//! makes processor behaviour undefined when the TLB holds both a large-page
//! and a 4 KiB translation for the same linear range **and the two differ with
//! respect to page frame or attributes**. So the split itself is safe: the
//! table Linux installs is filled, entry by entry, with translations that are
//! *identical* to the huge leaf it replaces — same output frames in order,
//! same attribute bits — and the swap is one naturally-aligned 8-byte store,
//! so no CPU ever sees a half-built entry. A CPU holding the stale huge entry
//! and a CPU walking the fresh table compute the same answer, so there is
//! nothing to break-before-make against.
//!
//! What is *not* safe is changing the attributes while a stale huge entry can
//! still exist. Linux's ordering is therefore **split → `flush_tlb_all()` →
//! only then change the PTE**, and the flush is inside the lock so no other
//! CPU can start a permission change against a leaf whose huge parent is still
//! cached. [`split_leaf`] mirrors that: it ends with
//! `flush_user_tlb_all_cpus()`, which is synchronous — it INVPCID/CR3-flushes
//! locally and then broadcasts through `shoot_full`, which spins for every
//! peer's ack before returning. The permission store happens after that call
//! returns, on the next turn of the walk loop. Every writer here holds
//! `bpf_text`'s `PACKS` lock for the whole sequence, which is this tree's
//! stand-in for `cpa_lock`.
//!
//! Changing an attribute needs its own invalidation too, and that one is *not*
//! the split's: [`set_range_writable`] ends with a synchronous
//! `invlpg_global_range` over the range it rewrote. The split's flush happens
//! before the permission store, and when no split was needed it does not happen
//! at all — which left the protection correct in the page tables and inert in
//! the TLB. `smoke_text_poke_protect_round_trip` is what found that.
//!
//! `PACKS` is also the whole of the serialisation argument, so it is worth
//! being explicit about what it does *not* cover. `paging.rs` guards
//! `map_4kb` / `unmap_4kb` with a per-root shard lock (`pt_lock_for`), and
//! [`set_leaf_writable`] does not take it — it walks the tables directly. The
//! two cannot collide: `map_4kb` refuses to descend through a huge leaf
//! (`EncounteredHugePage`) and only installs tables under *absent* entries,
//! whereas this module only rewrites *present* ones; and nothing in the tree
//! `map_4kb`s into the low identity map, the higher-half kernel window, or the
//! direct map, which are the only subtrees rewritten here. The one VA range
//! this module does hand to `map_4kb` — the poke window — lives in the BPF text
//! slot, disjoint from all three. Lock order is `PACKS` → `pt_lock`, never the
//! reverse.
//!
//! On aarch64 the same reasoning does **not** apply, and this module does not
//! pretend otherwise. ARMv8 requires break-before-make when a translation's
//! block size changes, and a BBM on the linear map would unmap live kernel
//! memory on every other CPU for the duration. Linux arm64 refuses the same
//! thing — it does not split the linear map, it boots it page-mapped when it
//! knows it will need to change permissions (`rodata_full` /
//! `can_set_direct_map()`). NARF's aarch64 kernel window is built at **2 MiB**
//! granularity by `boot.S`, so a hugepage-backed pack — 2 MiB, naturally
//! aligned — is exactly one block descriptor and needs only a *permission*
//! change, which ARM permits without BBM. Anything finer would need a split,
//! so [`can_protect`] refuses it and the caller keeps the writable alias
//! rather than corrupting the machine. See §8.6 for what that leaves open.
//!
//! ## x86_64 needs `CR0.WP`
//!
//! At CPL=0 a store to a read-only page only faults when `CR0.WP` is set;
//! with `WP=0` supervisor writes ignore the R/W bit entirely (Intel SDM Vol 3
//! §4.6.1) and a read-only alias would be decoration. NARF's boot path set
//! `CR0.PG` and nothing else, so [`enable_write_protect`] sets `WP` explicitly
//! on the BSP and on every AP, and [`write_protect_enabled`] gates
//! [`protect_ro`] — if the bit is not set the request is refused as
//! [`PokeError::Unsupported`] rather than silently claiming a boundary that
//! does not exist.

// One 4 KiB scratch VA per CPU, in a top-level slot of its own. Its entry is
// installed by `reserve_kernel_slots` (§4.1) alongside the BPF windows, so
// mapping here needs no new PML4/L0 entry and is visible under whatever root
// is current.
//
// It used to be carved out of the BPF text slot, immediately above the 1 GiB
// `bpf_text` hands packs out of. That worked, but it made the text-patching
// scratch space an undocumented tenant of a slot named for BPF — and once
// `domain::confine_shared_slots` began removing that slot from domain clones
// that do not own it, "the BPF slot" silently meant "and every CPU's poke
// window too". Nothing depended on the coupling (patching runs at load/seal
// time on a task CR3, never inside a domain guard), so this is not a bug fix;
// it is making the layout say what it means, so the confinement table can
// name one tenant per slot.
//
// The slot is 277, above the arena's upper guard, and NOT 274 — the first
// apparently-free index above the text window. 274 and 276 are the arena's
// guard slots: they are claimed by *absence*, kept permanently unmapped so a
// runaway immediate displacement out of the arena cannot reach a mapped page
// (`bpf_arena.rs`), and `smoke_bpf_text_extable_recovers_probe_fault` also
// dereferences 274's base as an address nothing ever maps. Neither claim is
// visible by grepping for slot constants; both are enforced by the suite.
//
// Per-CPU rather than one global scratch VA on purpose. A single shared VA
// would need a cross-CPU shootdown on every teardown, because a peer that used
// it earlier could hold a stale translation to a *different* frame. With one
// VA per CPU only its owner ever forms a translation for it, so a local INVLPG
// after each map and each unmap is exactly sufficient — which is also why
// Linux's `text_poke` uses a per-CPU fixmap slot rather than a global one.
//
// Each slot is two pages apart so an off-by-one page never lands in a peer's
// window; the odd page is never mapped.
