//! KASLR — kernel + userspace ASLR.

//! Picks a random virtual-address slot for the kernel image base
//! and for each fresh user-mode AS's stack / mmap / brk arenas.
//!
//! Entropy sources, in priority order:
//!
//!   1. **RDRAND** (x86_64 only) — Intel CPRNG, AMD also implements
//!      it. Hardware reports CPUID(1).ECX[30]; the instruction itself
//!      sets CF on success. We loop up to [`RAND_RETRIES`] times on
//!      CF=0.
//!   2. **RDSEED** as a higher-quality alternative on the same path
//!      (CPUID(7, 0).EBX[18]).
//!   3. **TSC mix** — read the timestamp counter, splat-and-mix with
//!      a known-prime multiplier. Last resort; entropy is only
//!      "boot-time jitter," which is enough for ASLR slot picking
//!      but not for crypto.
//!
//! The "more secure than Linux" framing for KASLR is per-AS: each
//! new user-mode address space gets a fresh randomisation. Linux's
//! per-process mmap randomisation drains entropy at exec; NARF re-
//! seeds at every AS creation including kernel thread stacks
//! (a kernel ROP target leaks address layout that's pure-noise to a
//! second kernel thread).
//!
//! References:
//!   * Linux `arch/x86/boot/compressed/kaslr.c` for the boot-time
//!     slot picker (different problem — KASLR before paging).
//!   * Linux `arch/x86/mm/mmap.c::arch_pick_mmap_base` for per-task
//!     mmap randomisation.
