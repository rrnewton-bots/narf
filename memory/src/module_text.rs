//! `module_text` — the executable-image allocator for runtime-loaded kernel
//! modules (`narf-modules`).
//!
//! A loaded module needs three things the kernel heap cannot give it:
//!
//!   1. **Executable pages.** Every kernel window `mmu::init_mmu` builds is NX
//!      apart from the kernel's own text and the AP trampoline (see
//!      `x86_64/mmu.rs`, and `frame/src/aarch64/boot.S` for the PXN|UXN twin).
//!      A module relocated into a `Vec<u8>` is unreachable by the instruction
//!      fetcher — its first instruction faults.
//!   2. **A virtual address inside the arch's call range.** x86_64 modules are
//!      compiled with `R_X86_64_PLT32` call relocations whose displacement is a
//!      signed 32-bit field: a module more than 2 GiB from the kernel symbol it
//!      calls cannot be relocated at all, only rejected. [`MODULE_VA_BASE`] is
//!      chosen to make that impossible rather than unlikely — see below.
//!   3. **Per-section permissions.** Text must end up RX, rodata RO, data RW,
//!      and no page may ever be both writable and executable — including
//!      through the linear-map alias of its backing frames.
//!
//! ## Window placement, and why it is not next to the BPF windows
//!
//! `bpf_text` puts JIT text at `0xFFFF_8880_0000_0000` (PML4 slot 273) and can
//! afford to: the BPF JIT emits its own calls as absolute `mov rax, imm64` +
//! `call rax`, so distance to the kernel is irrelevant. A module is different —
//! it is compiled by rustc/LLVM as an ordinary relocatable object, and every
//! call it makes to an exported kernel symbol arrives as a PC-relative 32-bit
//! displacement. From slot 273 the kernel image is ~131 TiB away and *every*
//! such relocation overflows.
//!
//! So modules go immediately above the kernel image instead:
//!
//! ```text
//!   x86_64   PML4[511] PDPT[510]  0xFFFF_FFFF_8000_0000  kernel image (1 GiB)
//!            PML4[511] PDPT[511]  0xFFFF_FFFF_C000_0000  module images  ← here
//! ```
//!
//! The whole module window is within +1.25 GiB of any kernel symbol, so PC32
//! and PLT32 resolve directly and no GOT or PLT synthesis is needed on x86_64.
//! Linux places its module region the same way and for the same reason
//! (`arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable_64_types.h::MODULES_VADDR`).
//!
//! PML4[511] is already present in every address space — `init_mmu` installs it
//! at boot and `new_user_pml4_on` snapshot-copies PML4[256..512] **by value**,
//! so every root holds the same PDPT frame *by pointer*. Populating PDPT[511]
//! inside that shared frame therefore propagates to every address space with no
//! reservation step, which is why this module has no `reserve_kernel_slots`
//! twin and no §4.1 boot-ordering hazard. It only borrows `bpf_text`'s record
//! of the kernel root, exactly as `vmalloc` does.
//!
//! ```text
//!   aarch64  L0[510] L1[511] 0xFFFF_FF7F_F800_0000  module images  ← here
//!            L0[511] L1[0]   0xFFFF_FF80_0000_0000  linear map: phys 0-1 GiB
//!            L0[511] L1[1]   0xFFFF_FF80_4000_0000  linear map: phys 1-2 GiB
//!            L0[511] L1[2]   0xFFFF_FF80_8000_0000  linear map: phys 2-3 GiB
//! ```
//!
//! aarch64 goes **below** `KERNEL_VIRT_BASE`, not above. Everything at or
//! above it is the linear map: `PhysAddr::kernel_mut_ptr` is
//! `phys | KERNEL_PHYS_OFFSET` for every physical address, so the L1 slots
//! boot.S leaves empty are images of RAM it has not had to map, not free
//! address space. A window in slot 2 aliases live frames on any machine with
//! over 2 GiB. Below the base the linear map cannot reach, because it only
//! ever adds.
//!
//! aarch64 gets no equivalent free lunch on *range*, though: the window is
//! ~1.1 GiB from kernel text and `R_AARCH64_CALL26` reaches ±128 MiB, so
//! aarch64 modules need PLT veneers in the relocator. Nowhere in the address
//! space is close enough — the GiB adjacent to the kernel image *is* the
//! linear map. Linux arm64 reaches the same conclusion from the same
//! constraint (`CONFIG_ARM64_MODULE_PLTS`,
//! `arch/arm64/kernel/module-plts.c`). This allocator is arch-neutral and does
//! not care which way it resolves; the relocator does.
//!
//! ## W^X
//!
//! Pages come back RW+NX so the loader can copy sections in and apply
//! relocations against their final addresses. [`protect`] then flips text to RX
//! and rodata to RO, and — this is the half that is easy to forget — asks
//! [`crate::text_poke`] to make every *other* kernel alias of those frames
//! read-only too. Without that second step the linear map still offers a
//! writable window onto memory that is executable at its module VA, which is
//! precisely the primitive W^X exists to deny. [`free`] restores the aliases
//! before the frames go back to the buddy; skipping that would hand the next
//! owner memory it cannot write.
//!
//! On aarch64 `text_poke::can_protect` refuses sub-2-MiB ranges (making one
//! 4 KiB frame of a live 2 MiB linear-map block read-only would need
//! break-before-make on the kernel's own map). We record that the alias stayed
//! writable rather than failing the load, matching `bpf_text`'s fallback-pack
//! behaviour and Linux arm64's identical refusal.
//!
//! ## Mappings are not GLOBAL
//!
//! Module pages are unmapped at `rmmod`, so they must never carry the GLOBAL
//! bit: several TLB-flush paths deliberately retain global entries, and a
//! global module mapping would leave a stale executable translation on an idle
//! peer after unload. `vmalloc.rs::kernel_leaf_flags` documents the same
//! constraint for the same reason. `bpf_text` *does* set GLOBAL, and may,
//! because its VA is never recycled.
