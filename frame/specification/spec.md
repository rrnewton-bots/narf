# frame — Specification

> Status: **v1.0** (Stage 2 design lock). v0.2 tightened
> `enter_domain` re-entrancy + trap PKRS save; v1.0 locks the
> nested-exception policy, the per-CPU layout target, and the
> time-of-day ownership boundary.

## 1. Purpose & scope

**Owns:** Boot CPU bring-up, per-CPU state, privilege/domain configuration
(registering the set of PKS/MTE domains), IDT/GDT (x86_64) or exception
vector table (aarch64), trap/exception dispatch entry, panic path.

**Does NOT own:** Scheduling decisions (`scheduler/`), memory policy
(`memory/`), IRQ routing decisions (`interrupts/`). The Frame just gives
those subsystems the hooks they need.

## 2. Assumptions

- `boot/` has placed the kernel at its linked address with the MMU in a
  known state (see `arch/`).
- `arch/` provides CPU/MMU primitives.

## 3. Public interface

```rust
pub struct CpuLocal {
    id: CpuId,
    frame_state: FrameState,
    /// The domain currently active on this CPU. Updated *only* by
    /// `enter_domain` / `exit_domain` and by trap entry. Reading it
    /// from any other site is a bug.
    pub current_domain: DomainId,
    /// Snapshot of the PKRS/TCF state as of the most recent
    /// `enter_domain`. Exit restores from this.
    pub saved_domain_state: DomainSavedState,
    /* ... */
}
pub fn init_bsp(boot_info: &BootInfo) -> !;
pub fn init_ap(cpu: CpuId);
pub fn current() -> &'static CpuLocal;

/// Enter `id`. Saves the prior `DomainSavedState` into `CpuLocal` and
/// writes the new PKRS / TCF. Must be paired with `exit_domain`.
/// Requires interrupts disabled and the caller's current domain to be
/// recorded; nested entry into the same domain is a debug assert.
pub unsafe fn enter_domain(id: DomainId);

/// Exit the most recently entered domain, restoring the prior state.
/// Panics in debug if called without a matching `enter_domain`.
pub unsafe fn exit_domain();

pub fn panic(msg: &PanicInfo) -> !;
```

Trap entry is written in arch assembly and materialises the architecture-owned
`narf_arch::{x86_64,aarch64}::trap_frame::TrapFrame`. `frame` re-exports the
selected type and fans out to a Rust dispatcher. The scheduler consumes that
shared type directly; it does not define or cast a mirror layout.

The bare `zram` kernel-command-line flag explicitly installs memory's built-in
compressed-RAM swap backend during userspace bootstrap. Without it, NARF boots
with no swap area, matching Linux until a future `swapon(2)` path configures
one.

## 4. Invariants & safety properties

- There is exactly one `CpuLocal` per CPU, pinned to its per-CPU page.
- A trap handler never allocates.
- When CR4.TSD converts a subscribed ring-3 `RDTSC` into #GP, `frame/` decodes
  only exact opcode `0f 31`, calls userspace's typed instruction interceptor,
  writes the resulting low/high halves to EAX/EDX, and advances RIP by exactly
  two bytes. Every other #GP keeps the ordinary synchronous-fault path. The
  callback is non-allocating and non-parking and never receives the mutable
  trap frame; register and control-flow mutation remain owned here.
- Anonymous user demand faults that hit the protected memory reserve may yield
  only after memory has retired the page claim, released address-space and
  allocator locks, and frame has cleared the active per-CPU mempolicy slot.
  The waiter registry is a fixed `MAX_USER_TASKS`-entry array; registration and
  notification are bounded, allocate nothing, and use the task-owned scheduler
  waker so CPU migration/hotplug do not invalidate a wait. Exact reclaim-cycle
  completion wakes matching waiters through a generation-ordered handshake. A
  task retries only after such completion, for at most Linux's sixteen-cycle
  reclaim bound; no stackful task or table exhaustion fails without another
  park, and no path busy-yields.
- A kernel/current-EL fault inside guarded uaccess never enters that reclaim
  wait. The trap may make one non-parking demand-allocation attempt; reserve
  pressure falls through to the architecture probe fixup and becomes `EFAULT`.
  This keeps the per-CPU probe slot, x86 SMAP AC window, and IRQ mask within one
  uninterrupted task/CPU interval.
- x86 signal-frame writes use that guarded-uaccess path directly. A present
  stack page needs no address-space preflight; demand paging, stack growth, and
  COW are attempted by the synchronous fault handler, while an invalid or
  concurrently unmapped target reaches the probe fixup and terminates only the
  receiving task.
- **x86_64 trap entry clears the live direction flag before executing any
  compiler-generated code.** CPL3 may be interrupted between `std` and `cld`;
  the CPU-pushed RFLAGS retains that user state for `iretq`, while the kernel
  must run with DF=0 so Rust/System-V string operations move forward.
- `enter_domain` only runs with interrupts disabled and returns with them
  in the same state.
- **`enter_domain` is not re-entrant into the same domain.** Nested entry
  silently overwrites the PKRS/TCF snapshot in `CpuLocal` and collapses
  the exit pairing. Debug builds assert `current_domain != id`; release
  builds log a `tracing/` critical event and proceed (we do not panic in
  the trap path).
- **Trap entry saves PKRS / TCF to the trap frame *before* running any
  Rust code.** The arch-asm prologue does:

  1. `swapgs` (x86_64) / set `TPIDR_EL1` (aarch64 if needed).
  2. Save GP regs + PKRS (`rdmsr IA32_PKRS`) / TCF (aarch64 `MRS`) into
     the trap frame.
  3. Enter neutral Frame execution state: PKRS all-allow, the Frame PCID root,
     or MTE tag checks suspended while retaining `SCTLR_EL1.ATA`.
  4. Call `dispatch_trap(frame)`.
  5. On return: restore PKRS/TCF from the trap frame, restore GP regs,
     `iretq` / `eret`.

  Without step 2–3 the Frame would execute trap handling under the
  faulting domain's rights — a privilege-escalation pathway.
- **User x86 `#NM` is the deferred FP/SIMD restore boundary.** After the common
  prologue has entered Frame state, vector 7 from CPL3 asks the scheduler to
  restore only the currently published own-stack task image and returns to
  retry the faulting instruction. Vector 7 from CPL0, or without a matching
  published task/image, remains on the fatal exception path.
- **x86 signal-frame FP capture and restore materialize scheduler-owned lazy
  state before FXSAVE/FXRSTOR.** Frame asks the scheduler to restore a deferred
  current-task image, clear CR0.TS, and mark the register file live before
  reading or replacing it. Frame must not independently clear TS for an
  own-stack task because that would make the scheduler skip the next save and
  could expose another task's register image.
- **NMI / double-fault / machine-check paths have their own IST-backed
  trap frames** and perform the same save/restore independently. They
  must not assume GS / TPIDR_EL1 is valid.
- Panic path never returns; it quiesces the system and hands over to
  `console/`. On SMP (Stage 2+) it broadcasts an `IPI-NMI` to halt APs
  before calling `console::panic_sink`.

## 5. Architecture notes

### x86_64
- GDT: kernel code, kernel data, user code, user data, TSS per CPU.
- IDT: 256 entries, trap gates for exceptions, interrupt gates for IRQs.
- Uses `swapgs` + per-CPU `KERNEL_GS_BASE` for `CpuLocal` pointer.
- **TSS IST slot assignments** (fixed, not negotiable):
  - IST1 — NMI.
  - IST2 — `#DF` (double fault).
  - IST3 — `#MC` (machine check).
  - IST4 — `#VC` (VMM communication, SEV-ES targets).
  - IST5..7 — reserved.
  Each IST slot has its own 16 KiB stack per CPU, allocated by
  `memory/` at AP bring-up time.
- The trap-frame prefix carries a saved state plus a discriminator: inactive,
  `IA32_PKRS`, or CR3/PCID. Fast `SYSCALL` entry uses the same ordering before
  Rust and restores the snapshot on both SYSRET and IRET exits.

### aarch64
- EL1 vector table aligned to 2 KiB; four groups of four vectors.
- `TPIDR_EL1` holds the `CpuLocal` pointer.
- SP_EL0 for user, SP_EL1 for kernel; SPSel=1 on entry.
- Each AP receives one contiguous 64 KiB kernel stack before `CPU_ON`. The AP
  entry trampoline uses its physical top with the MMU off, then rebases the
  empty stack to the high direct map before entering Rust. AP executor and IRQ
  work must never run on a single-page boot stack.
- **Stack alignment:** SP must be 16-byte aligned at EL1 vector entry;
  the vector prologue enforces this before any push.
- **MTE is suspended on vector entry.** The prologue clears
  `SCTLR_EL1.TCF/TCF0` while retaining `ATA`, then saves both SCTLR and GCR;
  the exact state is restored on `eret`. This prevents
  the trap handler itself from faulting on tag mismatches while
  running in Frame context.

## 6. Dependencies

- **Consumes:** `arch/`, `boot/`.
- **Provides to:** `scheduler/`, `memory/`, `interrupts/`, `console/` (panic), everything.

## 7. Stage assignment

Stage 1 (boot, trap dispatch, panic). Stage 2 (domain enter/exit hooks
once `memory/` has domains).

## 8. Resolved decisions

### 8.1 Nested-exception policy (resolved)

**Decision (was open):** **serialise** nested exceptions
explicitly via IST stacks (x86_64) and SP banking (aarch64).

The kernel has IST entries for NMI, #DF, #MC, #VC (per §5);
each gets its own 16 KiB stack. A nested exception arriving
mid-handler does not push onto the interrupted handler's
stack — it switches to the IST-assigned stack, preventing
stack overflow if the handler itself faults.

For non-IST exceptions (page fault, GP fault), the prologue
runs with `IF=0` (interrupt gate) so external IRQs cannot
nest. Synchronous faults nesting on synchronous faults
(double fault) are caught by #DF on its own IST.

aarch64 mirrors via SPSel=1 + separate vector groups for
"current EL with SP_EL1" vs "from lower EL" — same effect:
the handler context is segregated.

### 8.2 Per-CPU layout budget (resolved)

**Decision (was open):** **one cache line** for the hot fields,
not the entire `CpuLocal`. The hot-path fields:

```rust
#[repr(C, align(64))]
pub struct CpuLocalHot {
    pub current_task:    AtomicU64,    // task id
    pub current_domain:  DomainId,     // u8
    pub flags:           u8,
    pub padding:         [u8; 6],
    pub kernel_stack:    *mut u8,
    pub trap_frame_ptr:  *mut TrapFrame,
    pub saved_user_gs:   u64,          // x86_64 only; aarch64 = 0
    pub _reserved:       [u64; 3],
}
```

Cold fields (per-CPU run queue head, debug counters, GDT
pointer, IDT pointer) live elsewhere in the per-CPU page —
referenced through the hot struct's pointers when needed.

The 64-byte hot line is what `swapgs` / `TPIDR_EL1` points to
on x86_64 / aarch64 respectively. Fits in a single cache fetch
on every trap.

### 8.3 Time-of-day ownership (resolved)

**Decision (was open):** **`time/` owns time-of-day; `frame/`
owns the per-CPU TSC/timer counter cache only.**

`frame/` reads the raw counter (`RDTSC` / `CNTPCT_EL0`) for
the trap-entry timestamp embedded in the trap frame; it does
not convert to wall-clock. `time/` owns the wall-clock
calibration, leap-smear, NTP sync, and all conversion
arithmetic.

This is the existing v0.2 boundary; v1.0 just locks it.

### 8.4 Trap frame layout

The trap frame is part of the kernel-side ABI between `frame/` assembly,
`arch/`'s shared Rust representation, and the executor's preemption hook.
Architecture modules own the exact `#[repr(C)]` layouts and compile-time offset
assertions. `frame` and `scheduler` may not redeclare or cast mirror structs.
The schematic common portion is:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct TrapFrame {
    // saved domain state is the first field, so entry can neutralise rights
    // before exposing any Rust reference to the remainder
    pub domain:    ArchDomainTrapState,
    // GPRs (arch-specific layout — 15 on x86_64, 31 on aarch64)
    pub gpr:       [u64; ARCH_GPR_COUNT],
    // architectural fields
    pub vector:    u64,            // IDT vector / exception class
    pub err_code:  u64,            // page-fault error / FAR_EL1 /...
    pub rip:       u64,            // saved RIP / ELR_EL1
    pub cs_or_spsr:u64,            // saved CS / SPSR_EL1
    pub rflags_:   u64,            // saved RFLAGS / 0 (aarch64)
    pub rsp:       u64,            // saved RSP / SP_EL0
    pub ss_or_zero:u64,            // saved SS / 0
}
```

Drivers do not see this struct (it's in `DOMAIN_FRAME`,
TCB-only). Tracing / observability / panic-dump code that
needs to inspect a trap frame holds `Cap<Diagnostics, Read>`.
