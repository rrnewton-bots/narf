//! QSBR — quiescent-state-based reclamation.
//!
//! Spec: `rcu/specification/spec.md` §3.3 + §3.7. The idea is minimal:
//!
//! - A monotonic **global epoch** counter. `sync()` samples it, then
//!   waits for every CPU to have reported quiescence with a local
//!   "last-seen" epoch `>= target`.
//! - A **per-CPU reader-in-flight counter** (`active_readers`). `pin()`
//!   bumps it; the guard's `Drop` bumps it down. A CPU counts as
//!   quiescent for epoch `E` when it stores `E` into `last_quiescent`
//!   *and* `active_readers == 0` at that moment.
//! - A **per-CPU intrusive deferred-drop list** stamped with the enqueue
//!   epoch, threaded through a header inside each managed allocation.
//!   Draining happens either in `sync()` or (Stage-3 main track) from
//!   a per-domain reclamation-worker Future.
//!
//! Scope (this crate):
//! - `all_cpus_past` is a real wait now that APs are up: peers cross the
//!   target epoch at their own poll boundaries, and an idle CPU
//!   publishes the `u64::MAX` "inactive" sentinel so it never holds a
//!   grace period open.
//! - `MAX_CPUS` from `narf_lib::percpu::MAX_CPUS` caps the arrays.
//! - Reclamation runs in-line on `sync()`; no worker Future yet.
//!
//! Invariants (spec §4): an object queued at epoch `E` is not dropped
//! until every CPU has `last_quiescent >= E`, observed with
//! `active_readers == 0`. On a well-behaved QSBR caller (§3.3) readers
//! do not span `.await`, so at any quiescent moment `active_readers` is
//! 0 for this CPU anyway.
